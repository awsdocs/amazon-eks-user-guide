# Installing or updating `eksctl`<a name="eksctl"></a>

This topic helps you install or update `eksctl`, a simple command line tool for creating and managing Kubernetes clusters on Amazon EKS\. `eksctl` provides the fastest and easiest way to create a new cluster with nodes for Amazon EKS\. For more information and to see the official documentation, see [https://eksctl\.io/](https://eksctl.io/)\.

**Prerequisite**  
The `kubectl` command line tool is installed on your device or AWS CloudShell\. The version can be the same as or up to one minor version earlier or later than the Kubernetes version of your cluster\. For example, if your cluster version is `1.23`, you can use `kubectl` version `1.22`,`1.23`, or `1.24` with it\. To install or upgrade `kubectl`, see [Installing or updating `kubectl`](install-kubectl.md)\.

**To install or update `eksctl`**

1. Determine whether you already have `eksctl` installed on your device\.

   ```
   eksctl version
   ```

   If you have `eksctl` installed in the path of your device, the example output is as follows\. If you want to update the version that you currently have installed with a later version, complete the next step, making sure to install the new version in the same location that your current version is in\.

   ```
   0.124.0
   ```

   If you receive no output, then you either don't have `eksctl` installed, or it's not installed in a location that's in your device's path\.

1. You can install `eksctl` on `macOS`, Linux, or Windows

------
#### [ macOS ]<a name="install-eksctl-macos"></a>

**To install or update `eksctl` on `macOS`**

   The easiest way to get started with Amazon EKS and macOS is by installing `eksctl` with Homebrew, an open\-source tool that can be installed using [these instructions](https://brew.sh/)\. The `eksctl` Homebrew recipe installs `eksctl` and any other dependencies that are required for Amazon EKS, such as `kubectl`\. The recipe also installs the [`aws-iam-authenticator`](install-aws-iam-authenticator.md), which is required if you don't have the AWS CLI version `1.16.156` or higher installed\.

   1. If you don't already have Homebrew installed on macOS, install it with the following command\.

      ```
      /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)"
      ```

   1. Install or upgrade `eksctl`\. If `eksctl` is already installed, the following command upgrades and relinks it\. Or if `eksctl` isn't installed yet, the following command installs Weaveworks Homebrew tap as needed, and then installs `eksctl`\.

      ```
      brew upgrade eksctl && { brew link --overwrite eksctl; } || { brew tap weaveworks/tap; brew install weaveworks/tap/eksctl; }
      ```

   1. Test that your installation was successful with the following command\.

      ```
      eksctl version
      ```
**Note**  
 The `GitTag` version should be at least `0.124.0`\. If not, check your terminal output for any installation or upgrade errors, or manually download an archive of the release from [https://github\.com/weaveworks/eksctl/releases/download/v0\.124\.0/eksctl\_Darwin\_amd64\.tar\.gz](https://github.com/weaveworks/eksctl/releases/download/v0.124.0/eksctl_Darwin_amd64.tar.gz), extract `eksctl`, and then run it\.

#### [ Linux ]<a name="install-eksctl-linux"></a>

**To install or update `eksctl` on Linux**

   1. Download and extract the latest release of `eksctl` with the following command\.

      ```
      curl --silent --location "https://github.com/weaveworks/eksctl/releases/latest/download/eksctl_$(uname -s)_amd64.tar.gz" | tar xz -C /tmp
      ```

   1. Move the extracted binary to `/usr/local/bin`\.

      ```
      sudo mv /tmp/eksctl /usr/local/bin
      ```

   1. Test that your installation was successful with the following command\.

      ```
      eksctl version
      ```
**Note**  
The `GitTag` version should be at least `0.124.0`\. If not, check your terminal output for any installation or upgrade errors, or replace the address in step 1 with `https://github.com/weaveworks/eksctl/releases/download/v0.124.0/eksctl_Linux_amd64.tar.gz` and complete steps 1\-3 again\.

**To install or update `eksctl` on Windows**

   1. If you do not already have Chocolatey installed on your Windows system, see [Installing Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/install)\.

   1. Install or upgrade `eksctl`\.
      + Install the binaries with the following command:
