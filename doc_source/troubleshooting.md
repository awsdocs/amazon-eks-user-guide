# Amazon EKS Troubleshooting<a name="troubleshooting"></a>

This chapter covers some common errors that you may see while using Amazon EKS and how to work around them\.

## Insufficient Capacity<a name="ICE"></a>

If you receive the following error while attempting to create an Amazon EKS cluster, then one of the Availability Zones you specified does not have sufficient capacity to support a cluster\.

`Cannot create cluster 'example-cluster' because us-east-1d, the targeted availability zone, does not currently have sufficient capacity to support the cluster. Retry and choose from these availability zones: us-east-1a, us-east-1b, us-east-1c`

Retry creating your cluster with subnets in your cluster VPC that are hosted in the Availability Zones returned by this error message\.

## `aws-iam-authenticator` Not Found<a name="no-auth-provider"></a>

If you receive the error `"aws-iam-authenticator": executable file not found in $PATH`, then your kubectl is not configured for Amazon EKS\. For more information, see [Installing `aws-iam-authenticator`](install-aws-iam-authenticator.md)\.

## Worker Nodes Fail to Join Cluster<a name="worker-node-fail"></a>

There are a few common reasons that prevent worker nodes from joining the cluster:
+ The `aws-auth-cm.yaml` file does not have the correct IAM role ARN for your worker nodes\. Ensure that the worker node IAM role ARN \(not the instance profile ARN\) is specified in your `aws-auth-cm.yaml` file\. For more information, see [Launching Amazon EKS Linux Worker Nodes](launch-workers.md)\.
+ The **ClusterName** in your worker node AWS CloudFormation template does not exactly match the name of the cluster you want your worker nodes to join\. Passing an incorrect value to this field results in an incorrect configuration of the worker node's `/var/lib/kubelet/kubeconfig` file, and the nodes will not join the cluster\.
+ The worker node is not tagged as being *owned* by the cluster\. Your worker nodes must have the following tag applied to them, where `<cluster_name>` is replaced with the name of your cluster\.    
[\[See the AWS documentation website for more details\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/troubleshooting.html)

## Unauthorized or Access Denied \(`kubectl`\)<a name="unauthorized"></a>

If you receive one of the following errors while running kubectl commands, then your kubectl is not configured properly for Amazon EKS or the IAM user or role credentials that you are using do not map to a Kubernetes RBAC user with sufficient permissions in your Amazon EKS cluster\.
+ `could not get token: AccessDenied: Access denied`
+ `error: You must be logged in to the server (Unauthorized)`
+ `error: the server doesn't have a resource type "svc"`

This could be because the cluster was created with one set of AWS credentials \(from an IAM user or role\), and kubectl is using a different set of credentials\.

When an Amazon EKS cluster is created, the IAM entity \(user or role\) that creates the cluster is added to the Kubernetes RBAC authorization table as the administrator \(with `system:master` permissions\)\. Initially, only that IAM user can make calls to the Kubernetes API server using kubectl\. For more information, see [Managing Users or IAM Roles for your Cluster](add-user-role.md)\. Also, the [AWS IAM Authenticator for Kubernetes](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/aws-iam-authenticator) uses the AWS SDK for Go to authenticate against your Amazon EKS cluster\. If you use the console to create the cluster, you must ensure that the same IAM user credentials are in the AWS SDK credential chain when you are running kubectl commands on your cluster\.

If you install and configure the AWS CLI, you can configure the IAM credentials for your user\. If the AWS CLI is configured properly for your user, then the [AWS IAM Authenticator for Kubernetes](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/aws-iam-authenticator) can find those credentials as well\. For more information, see [Configuring the AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-getting-started.html) in the *AWS Command Line Interface User Guide*\.

If you assumed a role to create the Amazon EKS cluster, you must ensure that kubectl is configured to assume the same role\. Use the following command to update your kubeconfig file to use an IAM role\. For more information, see [Create a `kubeconfig` for Amazon EKS](create-kubeconfig.md)\.

```
aws --region region eks update-kubeconfig --name cluster_name --role-arn arn:aws:iam::aws_account_id:role/role_name
```

To map an IAM user to a Kubernetes RBAC user, see [Managing Users or IAM Roles for your Cluster](add-user-role.md)\.

## `hostname doesn't match`<a name="python-version"></a>

Your system's Python version must be 2\.7\.9 or greater\. Otherwise, you receive `hostname doesn't match` errors with AWS CLI calls to Amazon EKS\. For more information, see [What are "hostname doesn't match" errors?](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/community/faq/#what-are-hostname-doesn-t-match-errors) in the Python Requests FAQ\.

## `getsockopt: no route to host`<a name="troubleshoot-docker-cidr"></a>

Docker runs in the `172.17.0.0/16` CIDR range in Amazon EKS clusters\. We recommend that your cluster's VPC subnets do not overlap this range\. Otherwise, you will receive the following error:

```
Error: : error upgrading connection: error dialing backend: dial tcp 172.17.nn.nn:10250: getsockopt: no route to host
```

## Managed Node Group Errors<a name="troubleshoot-managed-node-groups"></a>

If your managed node group encounters a health issue, Amazon EKS returns an error message to help you to diagnose the issue\. The following error messages and their associated descriptions are shown below\.
+ **AutoScalingGroupNotFound**: We couldn't find the Auto Scaling group associated with the managed node group\. You may be able to recreate an Auto Scaling group with the same settings to recover\.
+ **Ec2SecurityGroupNotFound**: We couldn't find the cluster security group for the cluster\. You must recreate your cluster\.
+ **Ec2SecurityGroupDeletionFailure**: We could not delete the remote access security group for your managed node group\. Remove any dependencies from the security group\.
+ **Ec2LaunchTemplateNotFound**: We couldn't find the Amazon EC2 launch template for your managed node group\. You may be able to recreate a launch template with the same settings to recover\.
+ **Ec2LaunchTemplateVersionMismatch**: The Amazon EC2 launch template version for your managed node group does not match the version that Amazon EKS created\. You may be able to revert to the version that Amazon EKS created to recover\.
+ **IamInstanceProfileNotFound**: We couldn't find the IAM instance profile for your managed node group\. You may be able to recreate an instance profile with the same settings to recover\.
+ **IamNodeRoleNotFound**: We couldn't find the IAM role for your managed node group\. You may be able to recreate an IAM role with the same settings to recover\.
+ **AsgInstanceLaunchFailures**: Your Auto Scaling group is experiencing failures while attempting to launch instances\.
+ **NodeCreationFailure**: Your launched instances are unable to register with your Amazon EKS cluster\. Common causes of this failure are insufficient [worker node IAM role](worker_node_IAM_role.md) permissions or lack of outbound internet access for the nodes\. 
+ **InstanceLimitExceeded**: Your AWS account is unable to launch any more instances of the specified instance type\. You may be able to request an Amazon EC2 instance limit increase to recover\.
+ **InsufficientFreeAddresses**: One or more of the subnets associated with your managed node group does not have enough available IP addresses for new nodes\.
+ **AccessDenied**: Amazon EKS or one or more of your managed nodes is unable to communicate with your cluster API server\.
+ **InternalFailure**: These errors are usually caused by an Amazon EKS server\-side issue\.

## CNI Log Collection Tool<a name="troubleshoot-cni"></a>

The Amazon VPC CNI plugin for Kubernetes has its own troubleshooting script \(which is available on worker nodes at `/opt/cni/bin/aws-cni-support.sh`\) that you can use to collect diagnostic logs for support cases and general troubleshooting\.

The script collects the following diagnostic information:
+ L\-IPAMD introspection data
+ Metrics
+ Kubelet introspection data
+ `ifconfig` output
+ `ip rule show` output
+ `iptables-save` output
+ `iptables -nvL` output
+ `iptables -nvL -t nat` output
+ A dump of the CNI configuration
+ Kubelet logs
+ Stored `/var/log/messages`
+ Worker node's route table information \(via `ip route`\)
+ The `sysctls` output of `/proc/sys/net/ipv4/conf/{all,default,eth0}/rp_filter`

Use the following command to run the script on your worker node:

```
sudo bash /opt/cni/bin/aws-cni-support.sh
```

**Note**  
If the script is not present at that location, then the CNI container failed to run\. You can manually download and run the script with the following command:  

```
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aws/amazon-vpc-cni-k8s/master/scripts/aws-cni-support.sh | sudo bash
```

The diagnostic information is collected and stored at `/var/log/aws-routed-eni/aws-cni-support.tar.gz`\.
