# Review release notes for Kubernetes versions on extended support<a name="kubernetes-versions-extended"></a>

This topic gives important changes to be aware of for each Kubernetes version in extended support\. When upgrading, carefully review the changes that have occurred between the old and new versions for your cluster\.

## Kubernetes 1\.27<a name="kubernetes-1.27"></a>

Kubernetes `1.27` is now available in Amazon EKS\. For more information about Kubernetes `1.27`, see the [official release announcement](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2023/04/11/kubernetes-v1-27-release/)\.

**Important**  
The support for the alpha `seccomp` annotations `seccomp.security.alpha.kubernetes.io/pod` and `container.seccomp.security.alpha.kubernetes.io` annotations was removed\. The alpha `seccomp` annotations was deprecated in `1.19`, and with their removal in `1.27`, `seccomp` fields will no longer auto\-populate for `Pods` with `seccomp` annotations\. Instead, use the `securityContext.seccompProfile` field for `Pods` or containers to configure `seccomp` profiles\. To check whether you are using the deprecated alpha `seccomp` annotations in your cluster, run the following command:  

  ```
  kubectl get pods --all-namespaces -o json | grep -E 'seccomp.security.alpha.kubernetes.io/pod|container.seccomp.security.alpha.kubernetes.io'
  ```
The `--container-runtime` command line argument for the `kubelet` was removed\. The default container runtime for Amazon EKS has been `containerd` since `1.24`, which eliminates the need to specify the container runtime\. From `1.27` onwards, Amazon EKS will ignore the `--container-runtime` argument passed to any bootstrap scripts\. It is important that you don't pass this argument to `--kubelet-extra-args` in order to prevent errors during the node bootstrap process\. You must remove the `--container-runtime` argument from all of your node creation workflows and build scripts\.
+ The `kubelet` in Kubernetes `1.27` increased the default `kubeAPIQPS` to `50` and `kubeAPIBurst` to `100`\. These enhancements allow the `kubelet` to handle a higher volume of API queries, improving response times and performance\. When the demands for `Pods` increase, due to scaling requirements, the revised defaults ensure that the `kubelet` can efficiently manage the increased workload\. As a result, `Pod` launches are quicker and cluster operations are more effective\.
+ You can use more fine grained `Pod` topology to spread policies such as `minDomain`\. This parameter gives you the ability to specify the minimum number of domains your `Pods` should be spread across\. `nodeAffinityPolicy` and `nodeTaintPolicy` allow for an extra level of granularity in governing `Pod` distribution\. This is in accordance to node affinities, taints, and the `matchLabelKeys` field in the `topologySpreadConstraints` of your `Pod's` specification\. This permits the selection of `Pods` for spreading calculations following a rolling upgrade\.
+ Kubernetes`1.27` promoted to beta a new policy mechanism for `StatefulSets` that controls the lifetime of their `PersistentVolumeClaims`\(`PVCs`\)\. The new `PVC` retention policy lets you specify if the `PVCs` generated from the `StatefulSet` spec template will be automatically deleted or retained when the `StatefulSet` is deleted or replicas in the `StatefulSet` are scaled down\.
+ The [https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/kube-apiserver/](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/kube-apiserver/) option in the Kubernetes API server helps prevent `HTTP/2` client connections from being stuck on a single API server instance, by randomly closing a connection\. When the connection is closed, the client will try to reconnect, and will likely land on a different API server as a result of load balancing\. Amazon EKS version `1.27` has enabled `goaway-chance` flag\. If your workload running on Amazon EKS cluster uses a client that is not compatible with [https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7540#section-6.8](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7540#section-6.8), we recommend that you update your client to handle `GOAWAY` by reconnecting on connection termination\.

For the complete Kubernetes `1.27` changelog, see [https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.27.md#changelog-since-v1260](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.27.md#changelog-since-v1260)\.

## Kubernetes 1\.26<a name="kubernetes-1.26"></a>

Kubernetes `1.26` is now available in Amazon EKS\. For more information about Kubernetes `1.26`, see the [official release announcement](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2022/12/09/kubernetes-v1-26-release/)\.

**Important**  
Kubernetes `1.26` no longer supports CRI `v1alpha2`\. This results in the `kubelet` no longer registering the node if the container runtime doesn't support CRI `v1`\. This also means that Kubernetes `1.26` doesn't support containerd minor version `1.5` and earlier\. If you're using containerd, you need to upgrade to containerd version `1.6.0` or later before you upgrade any nodes to Kubernetes `1.26`\. You also need to upgrade any other container runtimes that only support the `v1alpha2`\. For more information, defer to the container runtime vendor\. By default, Amazon Linux and Bottlerocket AMIs include containerd version `1.6.6`\.
+ Before you upgrade to Kubernetes `1.26`, upgrade your Amazon VPC CNI plugin for Kubernetes to version `1.12` or later\. If you don't upgrade to Amazon VPC CNI plugin for Kubernetes version `1.12` or later, the Amazon VPC CNI plugin for Kubernetes will crash\. For more information, see [Working with the Amazon VPC CNI plugin for Kubernetes Amazon EKS add\-on](managing-vpc-cni.md)\.
+ The [https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/kube-apiserver/](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/kube-apiserver/) option in the Kubernetes API server helps prevent `HTTP/2` client connections from being stuck on a single API server instance, by randomly closing a connection\. When the connection is closed, the client will try to reconnect, and will likely land on a different API server as a result of load balancing\. Amazon EKS version `1.26` has enabled `goaway-chance` flag\. If your workload running on Amazon EKS cluster uses a client that is not compatible with [https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7540#section-6.8](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7540#section-6.8), we recommend that you update your client to handle `GOAWAY` by reconnecting on connection termination\.

For the complete Kubernetes `1.26` changelog, see [https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.26.md#changelog-since-v1250](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.26.md#changelog-since-v1250)\.

## Kubernetes 1\.25<a name="kubernetes-1.25"></a>

Kubernetes `1.25` is now available in Amazon EKS\. For more information about Kubernetes `1.25`, see the [official release announcement](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2022/08/23/kubernetes-v1-25-release/)\.

**Important**  
Starting with Kubernetes version `1.25`, you will no longer be able to use Amazon EC2 `P2` instances with the Amazon EKS optimized accelerated Amazon Linux AMIs out of the box\. These AMIs for Kubernetes versions `1.25` or later will support `NVIDIA 525` series or later drivers, which are incompatible with the `P2` instances\. However, `NVIDIA 525` series or later drivers are compatible with the `P3`, `P4`, and `P5` instances, so you can use those instances with the AMIs for Kubernetes version `1.25` or later\. Before your Amazon EKS clusters are upgraded to version `1.25`, migrate any `P2` instances to `P3`, `P4`, and `P5` instances\. You should also proactively upgrade your applications to work with the `NVIDIA 525` series or later\. We plan to back port the newer `NVIDIA 525` series or later drivers to Kubernetes versions `1.23` and `1.24` in late January 2024\.
`PodSecurityPolicy` \(PSP\) is removed in Kubernetes `1.25`\. PSPs are replaced with [Pod Security Admission \(PSA\)](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/security/pod-security-admission/) and Pod Security Standards \(PSS\)\. PSA is a built\-in admission controller that implements the security controls outlined in the [PSS ](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/security/pod-security-standards/)\. PSA and PSS are graduated to stable in Kubernetes `1.25` and are enabled in Amazon EKS by default\. If you have PSPs in your cluster, make sure to migrate from PSP to the built\-in Kubernetes PSS or to a policy\-as\-code solution before upgrading your cluster to version `1.25`\. If you don't migrate from PSP, you might encounter interruptions to your workloads\. For more information, see the [Pod security policy \(PSP\) removal FAQ](pod-security-policy-removal-faq.md)\. 
Kubernetes version `1.25` contains changes that alter the behavior of an existing feature known as API Priority and Fairness \(APF\)\. APF serves to shield the API server from potential overload during periods of heightened request volumes\. It does this by placing restrictions on the number of concurrent requests that can be processed at any given time\. This is achieved through the application of distinct priority levels and limits to requests originating from various workloads or users\. This approach ensures that critical applications or high\-priority requests receive preferential treatment, while simultaneously preventing lower priority requests from overwhelming the API server\. For more information, see [API Priority and Fairness](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/flow-control/) in the Kubernetes documentation or [API Priority and Fairness](https://aws.github.io/aws-eks-best-practices/scalability/docs/control-plane/#api-priority-and-fairness) in the EKS Best Practices Guide\.  
These updates were introduced in [PR \#10352](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/103521) and [PR \#118601](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/118601)\. Previously, APF treated all types of requests uniformly, with each request consuming a single unit of the concurrent request limit\. The APF behavior change assigns higher units of concurrency to `LIST` requests due to the exceptionally heavy burden put on the API server by these requests\. The API server estimates the number of objects that will be returned by a `LIST` request\. It assigns a unit of concurrency that is proportional to the number of objects returned\.  
Upon upgrading to Amazon EKS version `1.25` or higher, this updated behavior might cause workloads with heavy `LIST` requests \(that previously functioned without issue\) to encounter rate limiting\. This would be indicated by an HTTP 429 response code\. To avoid potential workload disruption due to `LIST` requests being rate limited, we strongly encourage you to restructure your workloads to reduce the rate of these requests\. Alternatively, you can address this issue by adjusting the APF settings to allocate more capacity for essential requests while reducing the capacity allocated to non\-essential ones\. For more information about these mitigation techniques, see [Preventing Dropped Requests](https://aws.github.io/aws-eks-best-practices/scalability/docs/control-plane/#preventing-dropped-requests) in the EKS Best Practices Guide\. 
Amazon EKS `1.25` includes enhancements to cluster authentication that contain updated YAML libraries\. If a YAML value in the `aws-auth` `ConfigMap` found in the `kube-system` namespace starts with a macro, where the first character is a curly brace, you should add quotation marks \(`“ ”`\) before and after the curly braces \(`{ }`\)\. This is required to ensure that `aws-iam-authenticator` version `v0.6.3` accurately parses the `aws-auth` `ConfigMap` in Amazon EKS `1.25`\.
The beta API version \(`discovery.k8s.io/v1beta1`\) of `EndpointSlice` was deprecated in Kubernetes `1.21` and is no longer served as of Kubernetes `1.25`\. This API has been updated to `discovery.k8s.io/v1`\. For more information, see [https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/deprecation-guide/#endpointslice-v125](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/deprecation-guide/#endpointslice-v125) in the Kubernetes documentation\. The AWS Load Balancer Controller `v2.4.6` and earlier used the `v1beta1` endpoint to communicate with `EndpointSlices`\. If you're using the `EndpointSlices` configuration for the AWS Load Balancer Controller, you must upgrade to AWS Load Balancer Controller `v2.4.7` *before* upgrading your Amazon EKS cluster to `1.25`\. If you upgrade to `1.25` while using the `EndpointSlices` configuration for the AWS Load Balancer Controller, the controller will crash and result in interruptions to your workloads\. To upgrade the controller, see [What is the AWS Load Balancer Controller?](aws-load-balancer-controller.md)\.
The beta API version \(`autoscaling/v2beta1`\) of HorizontalPodAutoscaler is no longer served as of Kubernetes `1.25`\. This API was deprecated in version `1.23`\. Migrate manifests and API clients to use the `autoscaling/v2` HorizontalPodAutoscaler API version\. For more information, see [the Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/deprecation-guide/#horizontalpodautoscaler-v125)\. 
+ `SeccompDefault` is promoted to beta in Kubernetes `1.25`\. By setting the `--seccomp-default` flag when you configure `kubelet`, the container runtime uses its `RuntimeDefault``seccomp` profile, rather than the unconfined \(`seccomp disabled`\) mode\. The default profiles provide a strong set of security defaults, while preserving the functionality of the workload\. Although this flag is available, Amazon EKS doesn't enable this flag by default, so Amazon EKS behavior is effectively unchanged\. If you want to, you can start enabling this on your nodes\. For more details, see the tutorial [Restrict a Container's Syscalls with seccomp](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/security/seccomp/#enable-the-use-of-runtimedefault-as-the-default-seccomp-profile-for-all-workloads/) in the Kubernetes documentation\.
+ Support for the Container Runtime Interface \(CRI\) for Docker \(also known as `dockershim`\) was removed from Kubernetes `1.24` and later\. The only container runtime in Amazon EKS official AMIs for Kubernetes `1.24` and later clusters is `containerd`\. Before upgrading to Amazon EKS `1.24` or later, remove any reference to bootstrap script flags that aren't supported anymore\. For more information, see [Amazon EKS ended support for `dockershim`](dockershim-deprecation.md)\.
+ The support for wildcard queries was deprecated in CoreDNS `1.8.7` and removed in CoreDNS `1.9`\. This was done as a security measure\. Wildcard queries no longer work and return `NXDOMAIN` instead of an IP address\.
+ The [https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/kube-apiserver/](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/kube-apiserver/) option in the Kubernetes API server helps prevent `HTTP/2` client connections from being stuck on a single API server instance, by randomly closing a connection\. When the connection is closed, the client will try to reconnect, and will likely land on a different API server as a result of load balancing\. Amazon EKS version `1.25` has enabled `goaway-chance` flag\. If your workload running on Amazon EKS cluster uses a client that is not compatible with [https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7540#section-6.8](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7540#section-6.8), we recommend that you update your client to handle `GOAWAY` by reconnecting on connection termination\.

For the complete Kubernetes `1.25` changelog, see [https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.25.md#changelog-since-v1240](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.25.md#changelog-since-v1240)\.

## Kubernetes 1\.24<a name="kubernetes-1.24"></a>

Kubernetes `1.24` is now available in Amazon EKS\. For more information about Kubernetes `1.24`, see the [official release announcement](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2022/05/03/kubernetes-1-24-release-announcement/)\.

**Important**  
Starting with Kubernetes `1.24`, new beta APIs aren't enabled in clusters by default\. By default, existing beta APIs and new versions of existing beta APIs continue to be enabled\. Amazon EKS follows the same behavior as upstream Kubernetes `1.24`\. The feature gates that control new features for both new and existing API operations are enabled by default\. This is in alignment with upstream Kubernetes\. For more information, see [KEP\-3136: Beta APIs Are Off by Default](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/blob/master/keps/sig-architecture/3136-beta-apis-off-by-default/README.md) on GitHub\.
Support for Container Runtime Interface \(CRI\) for Docker \(also known as `dockershim`\) is removed from Kubernetes `1.24`\. Amazon EKS official AMIs have containerd as the only runtime\. Before moving to Amazon EKS `1.24` or higher, you must remove any reference to bootstrap script flags that aren't supported anymore\. You must also make sure that IP forwarding is enabled for your worker nodes\. For more information, see [Amazon EKS ended support for `dockershim`](dockershim-deprecation.md)\.
If you already have Fluentd configured for Container Insights, then you must migrate Fluentd to Fluent Bit before updating your cluster\. The Fluentd parsers are configured to only parse log messages in JSON format\. Unlike `dockerd`, the `containerd` container runtime has log messages that aren't in JSON format\. If you don't migrate to Fluent Bit, some of the configured Fluentd's parsers will generate a massive amount of errors inside the Fluentd container\. For more information on migrating, see [Set up Fluent Bit as a DaemonSet to send logs to CloudWatch Logs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/Container-Insights-setup-logs-FluentBit.html)\.
In Kubernetes `1.23` and earlier, `kubelet` serving certificates with unverifiable IP and DNS Subject Alternative Names \(SANs\) are automatically issued with unverifiable SANs\. These unverifiable SANs are omitted from the provisioned certificate\. In version `1.24` and later clusters, `kubelet` serving certificates aren't issued if any SAN can't be verified\. This prevents `kubectl` exec and `kubectl` logs commands from working\. For more information, see [Certificate signing considerations before upgrading your cluster to Kubernetes 1\.24](cert-signing.md#csr-considerations)\.
When upgrading an Amazon EKS `1.23` cluster that uses Fluent Bit, you must make sure that it's running `k8s/1.3.12` or later\. You can do this by reapplying the latest applicable Fluent Bit YAML file from GitHub\. For more information, see [Setting up Fluent Bit](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/Container-Insights-setup-logs-FluentBit.html#Container-Insights-FluentBit-setup) in the Amazon CloudWatch User Guide\.
+ You can use Topology Aware Hints to indicate your preference for keeping traffic in zone when cluster worker nodes are deployed across multiple availability zones\. Routing traffic within a zone can help reduce costs and improve network performance\. By default, Topology Aware Hints are enabled in Amazon EKS `1.24`\. For more information, see [Topology Aware Hints](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/topology-aware-hints/) in the Kubernetes documentation\.
+ The `PodSecurityPolicy` \(PSP\) is scheduled for removal in Kubernetes `1.25`\. PSPs are being replaced with [Pod Security Admission \(PSA\)](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/security/pod-security-admission/)\. PSA is a built\-in admission controller that uses the security controls that are outlined in the [Pod Security Standards \(PSS\) ](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/security/pod-security-standards/)\. PSA and PSS are both beta features and are enabled in Amazon EKS by default\. To address the removal of PSP in version `1.25`, we recommend that you implement PSS in Amazon EKS\. For more information, see [Implementing Pod Security Standards in Amazon EKS](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/containers/implementing-pod-security-standards-in-amazon-eks/) on the AWS blog\.
+ The `client.authentication.k8s.io/v1alpha1` ExecCredential is removed in Kubernetes `1.24`\. The ExecCredential API was generally available in Kubernetes `1.22`\. If you use a client\-go credential plugin that relies on the `v1alpha1` API, contact the distributor of your plugin on how to migrate to the `v1` API\.
+ For Kubernetes `1.24`, we contributed a feature to the upstream Cluster Autoscaler project that simplifies scaling Amazon EKS managed node groups to and from zero nodes\. Previously, for the Cluster Autoscaler to understand the resources, labels, and taints of a managed node group that was scaled to zero nodes, you needed to tag the underlying Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling group with the details of the nodes that it was responsible for\. Now, when there are no running nodes in the managed node group, the Cluster Autoscaler calls the Amazon EKS `DescribeNodegroup` API operation\. This API operation provides the information that the Cluster Autoscaler requires of the managed node group's resources, labels, and taints\. This feature requires that you add the `eks:DescribeNodegroup` permission to the Cluster Autoscaler service account IAM policy\. When the value of a Cluster Autoscaler tag on the Auto Scaling group powering an Amazon EKS managed node group conflicts with the node group itself, the Cluster Autoscaler prefers the value of the Auto Scaling group tag\. This is so that you can override values as needed\. For more information, see [Scale cluster compute with Karpenter and Cluster Autoscaler](autoscaling.md)\.
+ If you intend to use Inferentia or Trainium instance types with Amazon EKS `1.24`, you must upgrade to the AWS Neuron device plugin version 1\.9\.3\.0 or later\. For more information, see [Neuron K8 release \[1\.9\.3\.0\]](https://awsdocs-neuron.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/latest/release-notes/containers/neuron-k8.html#id46) in the AWS Neuron Documentation\.
+ `Containerd` has `IPv6` enabled for Pods, by default\. It applies node kernel settings to Pod network namespaces\. Because of this, containers in a Pod bind to both `IPv4` \(`127.0.0.1`\) and `IPv6` \(`::1`\) loopback addresses\. `IPv6` is the default protocol for communication\. Before updating your cluster to version `1.24`, we recommend that you test your multi\-container Pods\. Modify apps so that they can bind to all IP addresses on loopback interfaces\. The majority of libraries enable `IPv6` binding, which is backward compatible with `IPv4`\. When it's not possible to modify your application code, you have two options:
  + Run an `init` container and set `disable ipv6` to `true` \(`sysctl -w net.ipv6.conf.all.disable_ipv6=1`\)\.
  + Configure a [mutating admission webhook](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/admission-controllers/#mutatingadmissionwebhook) to inject an `init` container alongside your application Pods\.

  If you need to block `IPv6` for all Pods across all nodes, you might have to disable `IPv6` on your instances\.
+ The [https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/kube-apiserver/](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/kube-apiserver/) option in the Kubernetes API server helps prevent `HTTP/2` client connections from being stuck on a single API server instance, by randomly closing a connection\. When the connection is closed, the client will try to reconnect, and will likely land on a different API server as a result of load balancing\. Amazon EKS version `1.24` has enabled `goaway-chance` flag\. If your workload running on Amazon EKS cluster uses a client that is not compatible with [https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7540#section-6.8](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7540#section-6.8), we recommend that you update your client to handle `GOAWAY` by reconnecting on connection termination\.

For the complete Kubernetes `1.24` changelog, see [https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.24.md#changelog-since-v1230](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.24.md#changelog-since-v1230)\.

## Kubernetes 1\.23<a name="kubernetes-1.23"></a>

Kubernetes `1.23` is now available in Amazon EKS\. For more information about Kubernetes `1.23`, see the [official release announcement](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2021/12/07/kubernetes-1-23-release-announcement/)\.

**Important**  
The Kubernetes in\-tree to container storage interface \(CSI\) volume migration feature is enabled\. This feature enables the replacement of existing Kubernetes in\-tree storage plugins for Amazon EBS with a corresponding Amazon EBS CSI driver\. For more information, see [Kubernetes 1\.17 Feature: Kubernetes In\-Tree to CSI Volume Migration Moves to Beta](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2019/12/09/kubernetes-1-17-feature-csi-migration-beta/) on the Kubernetes blog\.  
The feature translates in\-tree APIs to equivalent CSI APIs and delegates operations to a replacement CSI driver\. With this feature, if you use existing `StorageClass`, `PersistentVolume`, and `PersistentVolumeClaim` objects that belong to these workloads, there likely won't be any noticeable change\. The feature enables Kubernetes to delegate all storage management operations from the in\-tree plugin to the CSI driver\. If you use Amazon EBS volumes in an existing cluster, install the Amazon EBS CSI driver in your cluster before you update your cluster to version `1.23`\. If you don't install the driver before updating an existing cluster, interruptions to your workloads might occur\. If you plan to deploy workloads that use Amazon EBS volumes in a new `1.23` cluster, install the Amazon EBS CSI driver in your cluster before deploying the workloads your cluster\. For instructions on how to install the Amazon EBS CSI driver on your cluster, see [Use Amazon EBS storage](ebs-csi.md)\. For frequently asked questions about the migration feature, see [Amazon EBS CSI migration frequently asked questions](ebs-csi-migration-faq.md)\.
Extended Support for Amazon EKS optimized Windows AMIs that are published by AWS isn't available for Kubernetes version `1.23` but is available for Kubernetes version `1.24` and higher\.
+ Kubernetes stopped supporting `dockershim` in version `1.20` and removed `dockershim` in version `1.24`\. For more information, see [Kubernetes is Moving on From Dockershim: Commitments and Next Steps](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2022/01/07/kubernetes-is-moving-on-from-dockershim/) in the Kubernetes blog\. Amazon EKS will end support for `dockershim` starting in Amazon EKS version `1.24`\. Starting with Amazon EKS version `1.24`, Amazon EKS official AMIs will have `containerd` as the only runtime\.

  Even though Amazon EKS version `1.23` continues to support `dockershim`, we recommend that you start testing your applications now to identify and remove any Docker dependencies\. This way, you are prepared to update your cluster to version `1.24`\. For more information about `dockershim` removal, see [Amazon EKS ended support for `dockershim`](dockershim-deprecation.md)\.
+ Kubernetes graduated `IPv4`/`IPv6` dual\-stack networking for Pods, services, and nodes to general availability\. However, Amazon EKS and the Amazon VPC CNI plugin for Kubernetes don't support dual\-stack networking\. Your clusters can assign `IPv4` or `IPv6` addresses to Pods and services, but can't assign both address types\.
+ Kubernetes graduated the Pod Security Admission \(PSA\) feature to beta\. The feature is enabled by default\. For more information, see [Pod Security Admission](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/security/pod-security-admission/) in the Kubernetes documentation\. PSA replaces the [Pod Security Policy](https://aws.github.io/aws-eks-best-practices/security/docs/pods/#pod-security-solutions) \(PSP\) admission controller\. The PSP admission controller isn't supported and is scheduled for removal in Kubernetes version `1.25`\.

  The PSP admission controller enforces Pod security standards on Pods in a namespace based on specific namespace labels that set the enforcement level\. For more information, see [Pod Security Standards \(PSS\) and Pod Security Admission \(PSA\)](https://aws.github.io/aws-eks-best-practices/security/docs/pods/#pod-security-standards-pss-and-pod-security-admission-psa) in the Amazon EKS best practices guide\.
+ The `kube-proxy` image deployed with clusters is now the [minimal base image](https://gallery.ecr.aws/eks-distro-build-tooling/eks-distro-minimal-base-iptables) maintained by Amazon EKS Distro \(EKS\-D\)\. The image contains minimal packages and doesn't have shells or package managers\.
+ Kubernetes graduated ephemeral containers to beta\. Ephemeral containers are temporary containers that run in the same namespace as an existing Pod\. You can use them to observe the state of Pods and containers for troubleshooting and debugging purposes\. This is especially useful for interactive troubleshooting when `kubectl exec` is insufficient because either a container has crashed or a container image doesn't include debugging utilities\. An example of a container that includes a debugging utility is [distroless images](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/distroless#distroless-container-images)\. For more information, see [Debugging with an ephemeral debug container](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/debug/debug-application/debug-running-pod/#ephemeral-container) in the Kubernetes documentation\.
+ Kubernetes graduated the `HorizontalPodAutoscaler` `autoscaling/v2` stable API to general availability\. The `HorizontalPodAutoscaler` `autoscaling/v2beta2` API is deprecated\. It will be unavailable in `1.26`\.
+ The [https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/kube-apiserver/](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/kube-apiserver/) option in the Kubernetes API server helps prevent `HTTP/2` client connections from being stuck on a single API server instance, by randomly closing a connection\. When the connection is closed, the client will try to reconnect, and will likely land on a different API server as a result of load balancing\. Amazon EKS version `1.23` has enabled `goaway-chance` flag\. If your workload running on Amazon EKS cluster uses a client that is not compatible with [https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7540#section-6.8](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7540#section-6.8), we recommend that you update your client to handle `GOAWAY` by reconnecting on connection termination\.

For the complete Kubernetes `1.23` changelog, see [https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.23.md#changelog-since-v1220](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.23.md#changelog-since-v1220)\.
