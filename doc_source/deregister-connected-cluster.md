# Deregistering a cluster<a name="deregister-connected-cluster"></a>

If you are finished using a connected cluster, you can deregister it\. After it's deregistered, the cluster is no longer visible in the Amazon EKS console\.

You must have the following permissions to call the deregisterCluster API:
+ eks:DeregisterCluster
+ ssm:DeleteActivation
+ ssm:DeregisterManagedInstance

------
#### [ eksctl ]

**Prerequisites**
+ `eksctl` v0\.68 or above must be installed\. To install or upgrade it, see [Getting started with `eksctl` ](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/getting-started-eksctl.html)\.
+ Ensure the Amazon EKS Connector agent role was created\. \.<a name="connect-cluster-eksctl"></a>

**To deregister your cluster with eksctl**
+ For the Connector configuration, specify your Amazon EKS Connector agent IAM role\. For more information, see [Required IAM roles for Amazon EKS Connector](eks-connector.md#connector-iam-permissions)\.

  ```
  eksctl deregister cluster --name
  ```

------
#### [ AWS CLI ]

**Prerequisites**
+ AWS CLI must be installed\. To install or upgrade it, see [Installing the AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-install.html)\.
+ Ensure the Amazon EKS Connector agent role was created\. \.

Deregister the connected cluster\.

```
aws eks deregister-cluster \

     --name "my-first-registered-cluster" \
     --region AWS_REGION
```

#### [ AWS Management Console ]

1. Open the Amazon EKS console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/eks/home\#/clusters](https://console.aws.amazon.com/eks/home#/clusters)\.

1. Choose **Clusters**\.

1. On the **Clusters** page, select the connected cluster and select **Deregister**\.

**To clean up the resources on your Kubernetes cluster\.**

1. Delete the Amazon EKS Connector YAML file from your Kubernetes cluster\.

   ```
   kubectl delete -f eks-connector.yaml
   ```

1. If you created `clusterrole` or `clusterrolebinding` for an additional IAM user to access the cluster, ensure that you delete them from your Kubernetes cluster\.
