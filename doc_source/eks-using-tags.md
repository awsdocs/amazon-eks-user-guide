# Tagging your Amazon EKS resources<a name="eks-using-tags"></a>

To help you manage your Amazon EKS resources, you can assign your own metadata to each resource using *tags*\. This topic provides an overview of the tags function and shows how you can create tags\.

## Tag basics<a name="tag-basics"></a>

A tag is a label that you assign to an AWS resource\. Each tag consists of a *key* and an optional *value*, both of which you define\.

Tags enable you to categorize your AWS resources by, for example, purpose, owner, or environment\. When you have many resources of the same type, you can quickly identify a specific resource based on the tags you've assigned to it\. For example, you can define a set of tags for your Amazon EKS clusters to help you track each cluster's owner and stack level\. We recommend that you devise a consistent set of tag keys for each resource type\. You can then search and filter the resources based on the tags that you add\.

Tags are not automatically assigned to your resources\. After you add a tag, you can edit tag keys and values or remove tags from a resource at any time\. If you delete a resource, any tags for the resource are also deleted\.

Tags don't have any semantic meaning to Amazon EKS and are interpreted strictly as a string of characters\. You can set the value of a tag to an empty string, but you can't set the value of a tag to null\. If you add a tag that has the same key as an existing tag on that resource, the new value overwrites the earlier value\.

You can tag new or existing cluster resources using the AWS Management Console, the AWS CLI, or the Amazon EKS API\. You can tag only new cluster resources using `eksctl`\.

If you use AWS Identity and Access Management \(IAM\), you can control which users in your AWS account have permission to manage tags\.

## Tagging your resources<a name="tag-resources"></a>

You can tag new or existing Amazon EKS clusters and managed node groups\.

If you're using the Amazon EKS console, then you can apply tags to new or existing resources at any time\. You can do this by using the **Tags** tab on the relevant resource page\. If you're using `eksctl`, then you can apply tags to resources when they are created using the `--tags` option\.

If you're using the Amazon EKS API, the AWS CLI, or an AWS SDK, you can apply tags to new resources using the `tags` parameter on the relevant API action\. You can apply tags to existing resources using the `TagResource` API action\. For more information, see [TagResource](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/APIReference/API_TagResource.html)\.

Some resource\-creating actions enable you to specify tags for a resource when the resource is created\. If tags cannot be applied while a resource is being created, the resource fails to be created\. This mechanism ensures that resources you intended to tag on creation are either created with specified tags or not created at all\. If you tag resources at the time of creation, you don't need to run custom tagging scripts after creating a resource\.

The following table describes the Amazon EKS resources that can be tagged and the resources that can be tagged on creation\.


**Tagging support for Amazon EKS resources**  

| Resource | Supports tags | Supports tag propagation | Supports tagging on creation \(Amazon EKS API, AWS CLI, AWS SDK, and `eksctl`\) | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- | 
|  Amazon EKS clusters  |  Yes  | No\. Cluster tags do not propagate to any other resources associated with the cluster\. |  Yes  | 
|  Amazon EKS managed node groups  |  Yes  | No\. Managed node group tags do not propagate to any other resources associated with the node group\. |  Yes  | 
|  Amazon EKS Fargate profiles  |  Yes  | No\. Fargate profile tags do not propagate to any other resources associated with the Fargate profile, such as the pods that are scheduled with it\. |  Yes  | 

## Tag restrictions<a name="tag-restrictions"></a>

The following basic restrictions apply to tags:
+ Maximum number of tags per resource – 50
+ For each resource, each tag key must be unique, and each tag key can have only one value\.
+ Maximum key length – 128 Unicode characters in UTF\-8
+ Maximum value length – 256 Unicode characters in UTF\-8
+ If your tagging schema is used across multiple AWS services and resources, remember that other services may have restrictions on allowed characters\. Generally allowed characters are letters, numbers, spaces representable in UTF\-8, and the following characters: \+ \- = \. \_ : / @\.
+ Tag keys and values are case sensitive\.
+ Don't use `aws:`, `AWS:`, or any upper or lowercase combination of such as a prefix for either keys or values\. These are reserved only for AWS use\. You can't edit or delete tag keys or values with this prefix\. Tags with this prefix do not count against your tags\-per\-resource limit\.

## Working with tags using the console<a name="tag-resources-console"></a>

Using the Amazon EKS console, you can manage the tags associated with new or existing clusters and managed node groups\.

When you select a resource\-specific page in the Amazon EKS console, it displays a list of those resources\. For example, if you select **Clusters** from the navigation panel, the console displays a list of Amazon EKS clusters\. When you select a resource from one of these lists \(for example, a specific cluster\) that supports tags, you can view and manage its tags on the **Tags** tab\.

### Adding tags on an individual resource on creation<a name="adding-tags-creation"></a>

You can add tags to Amazon EKS clusters, managed node groups, and Fargate profiles when you create them\. For more information, see [Creating an Amazon EKS cluster](create-cluster.md)\.

### Adding and deleting tags on an individual resource<a name="adding-or-deleting-tags"></a>

Amazon EKS allows you to add or delete tags associated with your clusters directly from the resource's page\. 

**To add or delete a tag on an individual resource**

1. Open the Amazon EKS console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/eks/home\#/clusters](https://console.aws.amazon.com/eks/home#/clusters)\.

1. From the navigation bar, select the Region to use\.

1. In the navigation panel, choose **Clusters**\.

1. Choose a specific cluster, then scroll down and choose **Manage tags**\.

1. On the **Update tags** page, add or delete your tags as necessary\.
   + To add a tag — choose **Add tag** and then specify the key and value for each tag\.
   + To delete a tag — choose **Remove tag**\.

1. Repeat this process for each tag you want to add or delete, and then choose **Update** to finish\.

## Working with tags using the CLI, API, or `eksctl`<a name="tag-resources-api-sdk"></a>

Use the following AWS CLI commands or Amazon EKS API operations to add, update, list, and delete the tags for your resources\. You can only use `eksctl` to add tags to new resources\.

|  Delete one or more tags\.  |  [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/eks/untag-resource.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/eks/untag-resource.html)  |  [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/powershell/latest/reference/items/Remove-EKSResourceTag.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/powershell/latest/reference/items/Remove-EKSResourceTag.html)  |  [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/APIReference/API_UntagResource.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/APIReference/API_UntagResource.html)  | 

The following examples show how to tag or untag resources using the AWS CLI\.

**Example 1: Tag an existing cluster**  
The following command tags an existing cluster\.

```
aws eks tag-resource --resource-arn <resource_ARN> --tags <team>=<devs>
```

**Example 2: Untag an existing cluster**  
The following command deletes a tag from an existing cluster\.

```
aws eks untag-resource --resource-arn <resource_ARN> --tag-keys <tag_key>
```

**Example 3: List tags for a resource**  
The following command lists the tags associated with an existing resource\.

```
aws eks list-tags-for-resource --resource-arn <resource_ARN>
```

Some resource\-creating actions enable you to specify tags when you create the resource\. The following actions support tagging when creating a resource\.
