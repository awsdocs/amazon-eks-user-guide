# Creating an IAM OIDC provider for your cluster<a name="enable-iam-roles-for-service-accounts"></a>

Your cluster has an [https://openid.net/connect/](https://openid.net/connect/) \(OIDC\) issuer URL associated with it\. To use AWS Identity and Access Management \(IAM\) roles for service accounts, an IAM OIDC provider must exist for your cluster's OIDC issuer URL\.

**Prerequisites**
+ An existing Amazon EKS cluster\. To deploy one, see [Getting started with Amazon EKS](getting-started.md)\.
+ Version `2.9.9` or later or `1.27.36` or later of the AWS CLI installed and configured on your device or AWS CloudShell\. You can check your current version with `aws --version | cut -d / -f2 | cut -d ' ' -f1`\. Package managers such `yum`, `apt-get`, or Homebrew for macOS are often several versions behind the latest version of the AWS CLI\. To install the latest version, see [ Installing, updating, and uninstalling the AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-install.html) and [Quick configuration with `aws configure`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-quickstart.html#cli-configure-quickstart-config) in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide\. The AWS CLI version installed in the AWS CloudShell may also be several versions behind the latest version\. To update it, see [ Installing AWS CLI to your home directory](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudshell/latest/userguide/vm-specs.html#install-cli-software) in the AWS CloudShell User Guide\.
+ The `kubectl` command line tool is installed on your device or AWS CloudShell\. The version can be the same as or up to one minor version earlier or later than the Kubernetes version of your cluster\. For example, if your cluster version is `1.23`, you can use `kubectl` version `1.22`,`1.23`, or `1.24` with it\. To install or upgrade `kubectl`, see [Installing or updating `kubectl`](install-kubectl.md)\.
+ An existing `kubectl` `config` file that contains your cluster configuration\. To create a `kubectl` `config` file, see [Creating or updating a `kubeconfig` file for an Amazon EKS cluster](create-kubeconfig.md)\.

You can create an IAM OIDC provider for your cluster using `eksctl` or the AWS Management Console\.

------
#### [ eksctl ]

**Prerequisite**  
Version `0.124.0` or later of the `eksctl` command line tool installed on your device or AWS CloudShell\. To install or update `eksctl`, see [Installing or updating `eksctl`](eksctl.md)\.

**To create an IAM OIDC identity provider for your cluster with `eksctl`**

1. Determine whether you have an existing IAM OIDC provider for your cluster\.

   Retrieve your cluster's OIDC provider ID and store it in a variable\.

   ```
   oidc_id=$(aws eks describe-cluster --name my-cluster --query "cluster.identity.oidc.issuer" --output text | cut -d '/' -f 5)
   ```

1. Determine whether an IAM OIDC provider with your cluster's ID is already in your account\.

   ```
   aws iam list-open-id-connect-providers | grep $oidc_id | cut -d "/" -f4
   ```

   If output is returned, then you already have an IAM OIDC provider for your cluster and you can skip the next step\. If no output is returned, then you must create an IAM OIDC provider for your cluster\.

1. Create an IAM OIDC identity provider for your cluster with the following command\. Replace `my-cluster` with your own value\.

   ```
   eksctl utils associate-iam-oidc-provider --cluster my-cluster --approve
   ```

------
#### [ AWS Management Console ]<a name="create-oidc-console"></a>

**To create an IAM OIDC identity provider for your cluster with the AWS Management Console**

1. Open the Amazon EKS console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/eks/home\#/clusters](https://console.aws.amazon.com/eks/home#/clusters)\.

1. In the left pane, select **Clusters**, and then select the name of your cluster on the **Clusters** page\.

1. In the **Details** section on the **Overview** tab, note the value of the **OpenID Connect provider URL**\.

1. Open the IAM console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/iam/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/)\.

1. In the left navigation pane, choose **Identity Providers** under **Access management**\. If a **Provider** is listed that matches the URL for your cluster, then you already have a provider for your cluster\. If a provider isn't listed that matches the URL for your cluster, then you must create one\.

1. To create a provider, choose **Add provider**\.

1. For **Provider type**, select **OpenID Connect**\.

1. For **Provider URL**, enter the OIDC provider URL for your cluster, and then choose **Get thumbprint**\.

1. For **Audience**, enter **sts\.amazonaws\.com** and choose **Add provider**\.
