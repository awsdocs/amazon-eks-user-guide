# Deleting a managed node group<a name="delete-managed-node-group"></a>

This topic describes how you can delete an Amazon EKS managed node group\.

When you delete a managed node group, Amazon EKS randomly selects a node in your node group and sends a termination signal to the Auto Scaling group\. After which, Amazon EKS then sends a signal to drain the pods from the node\. If pods don't drain from a node for 15 minutes, then the pods are deleted\. This can happen, for example, when a pod disruption budget is too restrictive\. After the node is drained, it is terminated\. This step is repeated until all of the nodes in the Auto Scaling group are terminated, and then the Auto Scaling group is deleted\.

**Important**  
If you delete a managed node group that uses a node IAM role that isn't used by any other managed node group in the cluster, the role is removed from the [`aws-auth` ConfigMap](add-user-role.md)\. If any self\-managed node groups in the cluster are using the same node IAM role, the self\-managed nodes move to the `NotReady` status, and the cluster operation are also disrupted\. You can add the mapping back to the ConfigMap to minimize disruption\.

**To delete a managed node group**

1. Open the Amazon EKS console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/eks/home\#/clusters](https://console.aws.amazon.com/eks/home#/clusters)\.

1. Choose the cluster that contains the node group to delete\.

1. On the **Compute** tab, select the node group to delete, and choose **Delete**\.

1. On the **Delete Node group: <node group name>** page, type the name of the node group in the text field and choose **Delete**\.
