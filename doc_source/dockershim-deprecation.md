# Amazon EKS is ending support for `Dockershim`<a name="dockershim-deprecation"></a>

Kubernetes no longer supports `Dockershim`\. Additionally, the Kubernetes team plans to completely remove the runtime in Kubernetes version 1\.24\. Amazon EKS is ending support for `Dockershim` starting with the Kubernetes version 1\.23 launch\. Amazon EKS AMIs that are officially published will have `containerd` as the only runtime starting with version 1\.23\. This is targeted for end of the second quarter of 2022\. Amazon EKS AMIs that run Kubernetes version 1\.17 through 1\.21 use Docker as the default runtime, but have a bootstrap flag option that you can use to test out your workloads on any supported cluster today with `containerd`\. For more information, see [Enable the `containerd` runtime bootstrap flag](eks-optimized-ami.md#containerd-bootstrap)\.

We will continue to publish AMIs for existing Kubernetes versions until the end of their support date\. For more information, see [Amazon EKS Kubernetes release calendar](kubernetes-versions.md#kubernetes-release-calendar)\. If you require more time to test your workloads on `containerd`, you can stay on a supported version before 1\.23 and still be fully supported\. But, before you upgrade official Amazon EKS AMIs to version 1\.23, make sure to validate that your workloads run on `containerd`\. 

If you want to upgrade to version 1\.23 or higher and still use `Dockershim`, build your own AMI with Docker installed\. However, when Kubernetes removes `Dockershim` support, make sure that you migrate to `containerd` to remain on a supported version\. For more information, see [Kubernetes is Moving on From Dockershim: Commitments and Next Steps](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2022/01/07/kubernetes-is-moving-on-from-dockershim/) on the *Kubernetes Blog*\.

The `containerd` runtime provides more reliable performance and security, and it's the runtime we're standardizing on across Amazon EKS \(Fargate and Bottlerocket already use `containerd` only\)\. `containerd` helps to minimize the number of Amazon EKS AMI releases that are required to address `Dockershim` [Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures](https://cve.mitre.org/) \(CVEs\)\. As `Dockershim` already uses `containerd` internally, you might not need to make any changes\. However, there are some situations where changes might or must be required:
+ You must make changes for any application that mounts the Docker socket\. For example, building container images using a container are impacted\. Many monitoring tools also mount the Docker socket, such as Datadog\. You may have to wait for updates or re\-deploy workloads for runtime monitoring\.
+ You might need to make changes for any application that's reliant on specific Docker settings\. For example, using `HTTPS_PROXY` can require changes\. For more information, see [dockerd](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/dockerd/) in the *Docker Docs*\.
+ If you're using the Amazon ECR credential helper to pull images, you must switch to the `kubelet` image credential provider\. For more information, see [Configure a kubelet image credential provider](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/kubelet-credential-provider/kubelet-credential-provider/) in the Kubernetes documentation\.
