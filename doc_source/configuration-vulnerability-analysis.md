# Configuration and vulnerability analysis in Amazon EKS<a name="configuration-vulnerability-analysis"></a>

Security is a critical consideration for configuring and maintaining Kubernetes clusters and applications\. The [Center for Internet Security \(CIS\) Kubernetes Benchmark](https://www.cisecurity.org/benchmark/kubernetes/) provides guidance for Amazon EKS node security configurations\. The benchmark:
+ Is applicable to Amazon EC2 nodes \(both managed and self\-managed\) where you are responsible for security configurations of Kubernetes components\. 
+ Provides a standard, community\-approved way to ensure that you have configured your Kubernetes cluster and nodes securely when using Amazon EKS\.
+ Consists of four sections; control plane logging configuration, node security configurations, policies, and managed services\.
+ Supports all of the Kubernetes versions currently available in Amazon EKS and can be run using [kube\-bench](https://github.com/aquasecurity/kube-bench), a standard open source tool for checking configuration using the CIS benchmark on Kubernetes clusters\.

To learn more, see [Introducing The CIS Amazon EKS Benchmark](http://aws.amazon.com/blogs/containers/introducing-cis-amazon-eks-benchmark/)\.

Amazon EKS platform versions represent the capabilities of the cluster control plane, including which Kubernetes API server flags are enabled and the current Kubernetes patch version\. New clusters are deployed with the latest platform version\. For details, see [Platform versions](platform-versions.md)\.

You can [update an Amazon EKS cluster](update-cluster.md) to newer Kubernetes versions\. As new Kubernetes versions become available in Amazon EKS, we recommend that you proactively update your clusters to use the latest available version\. For more information about Kubernetes versions in EKS, see [Amazon EKS Kubernetes Versions](kubernetes-versions.md)\.

Track security or privacy events for Amazon Linux 2 at the [Amazon Linux Security Center](https://alas.aws.amazon.com/alas2.html) or subscribe to the associated [RSS feed](https://alas.aws.amazon.com/AL2/alas.rss)\. Security and privacy events include an overview of the issue affected, packages, and instructions for updating your instances to correct the issue\.

You can use [Amazon Inspector](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/inspector/latest/userguide/inspector_introduction.html) to check for unintended network accessibility of your nodes and for vulnerabilities on those Amazon EC2 instances\.
