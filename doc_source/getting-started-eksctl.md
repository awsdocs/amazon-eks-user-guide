# Getting started with `eksctl`<a name="getting-started-eksctl"></a>

This getting started guide helps you to install all of the required resources to get started with Amazon EKS using `eksctl`, a simple command line utility for creating and managing Kubernetes clusters on Amazon EKS\. At the end of this tutorial, you will have a running Amazon EKS cluster with a managed node group, and the `kubectl` command line utility will be configured to use your new cluster\. `eksctl` automatically creates several AWS resources for you\.

If you'd rather manually create most of the resources and better understand how they interact with each other, then use the AWS Management Console to create your cluster and worker nodes\. For more information, see [Getting started with the AWS Management Console](getting-started-console.md)\.

## Prerequisites<a name="eksctl-prereqs"></a>

This section helps you to install and configure the tools and resources that you need to create and manage an Amazon EKS cluster\.

### Install the AWS CLI<a name="install-awscli"></a>

To install the latest version of the AWS CLI, choose the tab with the name of the operating system that you'd like to install the AWS CLI on\.

------
#### [ macOS ]

If you currently have the AWS CLI installed, determine which version that you have installed\.

```
aws --version
```

If you don't have version 1\.18\.61 or later, or version 2\.0\.14 or later installed, then install the AWS CLI version 2\. For other installation options, or to upgrade your currently installed version 2, see [Upgrading the AWS CLI version 2 on macOS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2-mac.html#cliv2-mac-upgrade)\.

```
curl "https://awscli.amazonaws.com/AWSCLIV2.pkg" -o "AWSCLIV2.pkg"
sudo installer -pkg AWSCLIV2.pkg -target /
```

 If you're unable to use the AWS CLI version 2, then ensure that you have the latest version of the [AWS CLI version 1](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-macos.html) installed using the following command\.

```
pip3 install awscli --upgrade --user
```

------
#### [ Linux ]

If you currently have the AWS CLI installed, determine which version that you have installed\.

```
aws --version
```

If you don't have version 1\.18\.61 or later, or version or later installed, then install the AWS CLI version 2\. For other installation options, or to upgrade your currently installed version 2, see [Upgrading the AWS CLI version 2 on Linux](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2-linux.html#cliv2-linux-upgrade)\.

```
curl "https://awscli.amazonaws.com/awscli-exe-linux-x86_64.zip" -o "awscliv2.zip"
unzip awscliv2.zip
sudo ./aws/install
```

If you're unable to use the AWS CLI version 2, then ensure that you have the latest version of the [AWS CLI version 1](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-linux.html) installed using the following command\.

```
pip3 install --upgrade --user awscli
```

------
#### [ Windows ]

If you currently have the AWS CLI installed, determine which version that you have installed\.

```
aws --version
```

**To install the AWS CLI version 2**

If you don't have either version 1\.18\.61 or later, or version or later installed, then install the AWS CLI version 2 using the following steps\. For other installation options, or to upgrade your currently installed version 2, see [Upgrading the AWS CLI version 2 on Windows](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2-windows.html#cliv2-windows-upgrade)\.

1. Download the AWS CLI MSI installer for Windows \(64\-bit\) at [https://awscli\.amazonaws\.com/AWSCLIV2\.msi](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/AWSCLIV2.msi)

1. Run the downloaded MSI installer and follow the onscreen instructions\. By default, the AWS CLI installs to `C:\Program Files\Amazon\AWSCLIV2`\.

If you're unable to use the AWS CLI version 2, then ensure that you have the latest version of the [AWS CLI version 1](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-windows.html) installed using the following command\.

```
pip3 install --user --upgrade awscli
```

------

### Configure your AWS CLI credentials<a name="configure-awscli"></a>

Both `eksctl` and the AWS CLI require that you have AWS credentials configured in your environment\. The aws configure command is the fastest way to set up your AWS CLI installation for general use\.

```
$ aws configure
AWS Access Key ID [None]: AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE
AWS Secret Access Key [None]: wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY
Default region name [None]: region-code
Default output format [None]: json
```

When you type this command, the AWS CLI prompts you for four pieces of information: `access key`, `secret access key`, `AWS Region`, and `output format`\. This information is stored in a profile \(a collection of settings\) named `default`\. This profile is used when you run commands, unless you specify another one\.

For more information, see [Configuring the AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-configure.html) in the *AWS Command Line Interface User Guide*\.

### Install and configure kubectl<a name="eksctl-kubectl"></a>

Kubernetes uses the `kubectl` command\-line utility for communicating with the cluster API server\.

**Note**  
If you used the preceding Homebrew instructions to install `eksctl` on macOS, then `kubectl`  has already been installed on your system\. You can skip to [Create your Amazon EKS cluster and worker nodes](#eksctl-create-cluster)\.

To install version 1\.16 of the `kubectl` command line utility, choose the tab with the name of the operating system that you'd like to install `kubectl` on\. If you need to install a different version to use with a different cluster version, then see [Installing `kubectl`](install-kubectl.md)\.

------
#### [ macOS ]

**To install `kubectl` on macOS**

1. Download the Amazon EKS\-vended kubectl binary\.

   ```
   curl -o kubectl https://amazon-eks.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/1.16.8/2020-04-16/bin/darwin/amd64/kubectl
   ```

1. \(Optional\) Verify the downloaded binary with the SHA\-256 sum\.

   1. Download the SHA\-256 sum\.

      ```
      curl -o kubectl.sha256 https://amazon-eks.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/1.16.8/2020-04-16/bin/darwin/amd64/kubectl.sha256
      ```

   1. Check the SHA\-256 sum\.

      ```
      openssl sha1 -sha256 kubectl
      ```

   1. Compare the generated SHA\-256 sum in the command output against your downloaded SHA\-256 file\. The two should match\.

1. Apply execute permissions to the binary\.

   ```
   chmod +x ./kubectl
   ```

1. Copy the binary to a folder in your `PATH`\. If you have already installed a version of kubectl, then we recommend creating a `$HOME/bin/kubectl` and ensuring that `$HOME/bin` comes first in your `$PATH`\.

   ```
   mkdir -p $HOME/bin && cp ./kubectl $HOME/bin/kubectl && export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/bin
   ```

1. \(Optional\) Add the `$HOME/bin` path to your shell initialization file so that it is configured when you open a shell\.

   ```
   echo 'export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/bin' >> ~/.bash_profile
   ```

1. After you install kubectl, you can verify its version with the following command:

   ```
   kubectl version --short --client
   ```

------
#### [ Linux ]

**To install `kubectl` on Linux**

1. Download the Amazon EKS\-vended kubectl binary\.

   ```

   ```

1. \(Optional\) Verify the downloaded binary with the SHA\-256 sum\.

   1. Download the SHA\-256 sum\.

      ```
      curl -o kubectl.sha256 https://amazon-eks.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/1.16.8/2020-04-16/bin/linux/amd64/kubectl.sha256
      ```

   1. Check the SHA\-256 sum\.

      ```
      openssl sha1 -sha256 kubectl
      ```

   1. Compare the generated SHA\-256 sum in the command output against your downloaded SHA\-256 file\. The two should match\.

1. Apply execute permissions to the binary\.

   ```
   chmod +x ./kubectl
   ```

1. Copy the binary to a folder in your `PATH`\. If you have already installed a version of kubectl, then we recommend creating a `$HOME/bin/kubectl` and ensuring that `$HOME/bin` comes first in your `$PATH`\.

   ```
   mkdir -p $HOME/bin && cp ./kubectl $HOME/bin/kubectl && export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/bin
   ```

1. \(Optional\) Add the `$HOME/bin` path to your shell initialization file so that it is configured when you open a shell\.
**Note**  
This step assumes you are using the Bash shell; if you are using another shell, change the command to use your specific shell initialization file\.

   ```
   echo 'export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/bin' >> ~/.bashrc
   ```

1. After you install kubectl, you can verify its version with the following command:

   ```
   kubectl version --short --client
   ```

------
#### [ Windows ]

**To install `kubectl` on Windows**

1. Open a PowerShell terminal\.

### Install `eksctl`<a name="install-eksctl"></a>

To install 0\.21\.0 version or later of the `eksctl` command line utility, choose the tab with the name of the operating system that you'd like to install `eksctl` on\. For more information, see [https://eksctl\.io/](https://github.com/weaveworks/eksctl)\.

------
#### [ macOS ]

**To install or upgrade `eksctl` on macOS using Homebrew**

The easiest way to get started with Amazon EKS and macOS is by installing `eksctl` with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)\. The `eksctl` Homebrew recipe installs `eksctl` and any other dependencies that are required for Amazon EKS, such as `kubectl`\. The recipe also installs the [`aws-iam-authenticator`](install-aws-iam-authenticator.md), which is required if you don't have the AWS CLI version 1\.16\.156 or higher installed\.

1. If you do not already have Homebrew installed on macOS, install it with the following command\.

   ```
   /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)"
   ```

1. Install the Weaveworks Homebrew tap\.

   ```
   brew tap weaveworks/tap
   ```

1. Install or upgrade `eksctl`\.
   + Install `eksctl` with the following command:

     ```
     brew install weaveworks/tap/eksctl
     ```
   + If `eksctl` is already installed, run the following command to upgrade:

     ```
     brew upgrade eksctl && brew link --overwrite eksctl
     ```

1. Test that your installation was successful with the following command\.

   ```
   eksctl version
   ```
**Note**  
 The `GitTag` version should be at least `0.21.0`\. If not, check your terminal output for any installation or upgrade errors, or manually download an archive of the release from [https://github\.com/weaveworks/eksctl/releases/download/0\.21\.0/eksctl\_Darwin\_amd64\.tar\.gz](https://github.com/weaveworks/eksctl/releases/download/0.21.0/eksctl_Darwin_amd64.tar.gz), extract `eksctl`, and then execute it\.

------
#### [ Linux ]

**To install or upgrade `eksctl` on Linux using `curl`**

1. Download and extract the latest release of `eksctl` with the following command\.

   ```
   curl --silent --location "https://github.com/weaveworks/eksctl/releases/latest/download/eksctl_$(uname -s)_amd64.tar.gz" | tar xz -C /tmp
   ```

1. Move the extracted binary to `/usr/local/bin`\.

   ```
   sudo mv /tmp/eksctl /usr/local/bin
   ```

1. Test that your installation was successful with the following command\.

   ```
   eksctl version
   ```
**Note**  
The `GitTag` version should be at least `0.21.0`\. If not, check your terminal output for any installation or upgrade errors, or replace the address in step 1 with `https://github.com/weaveworks/eksctl/releases/download/0.21.0/eksctl_Linux_amd64.tar.gz` and complete steps 1\-3 again\.

#### [ Windows ]

**To install or upgrade `eksctl` on Windows using Chocolatey**

1. If you do not already have Chocolatey installed on your Windows system, see [Installing Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/install)\.

1. Install or upgrade `eksctl` \.
   + Install the binaries with the following command:

     ```
     chocolatey install -y eksctl 
     ```
   + If they are already installed, run the following command to upgrade:

     ```
     chocolatey upgrade -y eksctl 
     ```

1. Test that your installation was successful with the following command\.

   ```
   eksctl version
   ```
**Note**  
 The `GitTag` version should be at least `0.21.0`\. If not, check your terminal output for any installation or upgrade errors, or manually download an archive of the release from [https://github\.com/weaveworks/eksctl/releases/download/0\.21\.0/eksctl\_Windows\_amd64\.zip](https://github.com/weaveworks/eksctl/releases/download/0.21.0/eksctl_Windows_amd64.zip), extract `eksctl`, and then execute it\.

## Create your Amazon EKS cluster and worker nodes<a name="eksctl-create-cluster"></a>

This section helps you to create an Amazon EKS cluster and a managed worker node group\. The latest Kubernetes version available in Amazon EKS is installed so that you can take advantage of the latest Kubernetes and Amazon EKS features\. Some features are not available on older versions of Kubernetes\.

**To create your cluster with `eksctl`**

1. Choose a tab below that matches your workload requirements\. If you want to create a cluster that only runs pods on AWS Fargate, choose **AWS Fargate\-only cluster**\. If you only intend to run Linux workloads on your cluster, choose **Cluster with Linux\-only workloads**\. If you want to run Linux and Windows workloads on your cluster, choose **Cluster with Linux and Windows workloads**\.

------
#### [ AWS Fargate\-only cluster ]

   Create your Amazon EKS cluster with Fargate support with the following command\. You can replace *prod* with your own value and you can replace `us-west-2` with any [Amazon EKS Fargate supported Region](fargate.md)\. 

   We recommend that you deploy version *1\.16*\. If you must deploy an earlier version, then you can only replace it with version `1.14` or `1.15`\. If you change *1\.16*, then read the important [Amazon EKS release notes](kubernetes-versions.md) for the version and install the corresponding version of [`kubectl`](install-kubectl.md)\.

   ```
   eksctl create cluster \
   --name prod \
   --version 1.16 \
   --region us-west-2 \
   --fargate
   ```

   Your new Amazon EKS cluster is created without a worker node group\. However, `eksctl` creates a pod execution role, a [Fargate profile](fargate-profile.md) for the `default` and `kube-system` namespaces, and it patches the `coredns` deployment so that it can run on Fargate\. For more information see [AWS Fargate](fargate.md)\.

------
#### [ Cluster with Linux\-only workloads ]

   Create your Amazon EKS cluster and Linux worker nodes with the following command\. Replace the example *values* with your own values\. You can replace *`us-west-2`* with any Amazon EKS [supported Region](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/eks.html#eks_region)\. 

   We recommend that you deploy version *1\.16*\. If you must deploy an earlier version, then you can only replace it with version `1.14` or `1.15`\. If you must deploy a version earlier than `1.14`, then you must remove the `--managed` option\. If you change *1\.16*, then read the important [Amazon EKS release notes](kubernetes-versions.md) for the version and install the corresponding version of [`kubectl`](install-kubectl.md)\.

   Though `--ssh-public-key` is optional, we highly recommend that you specify it when you create your node group with a cluster\. This option enables SSH access to the nodes in your managed node group\. Enabling SSH access allows you to connect to your instances and gather diagnostic information if there are issues\. You cannot enable remote access after the node group is created\. If you don't have a public key, you can [create a key pair](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-services-ec2-keypairs.html#creating-a-key-pair) for Amazon EC2 and then [retrieve the public key](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-key-pairs.html#retrieving-the-public-key) for the key pair to specify for `--ssh-public-key`\. Ensure that you create the key in the same Region that you create the cluster in\.

   ```
   eksctl create cluster \
   --name prod \
   --version 1.16 \
   --region us-west-2 \
   --nodegroup-name standard-workers \
   --node-type t3.medium \
   --nodes 3 \
   --nodes-min 1 \
   --nodes-max 4 \
   --ssh-access \
   --ssh-public-key my-public-key.pub \
   --managed
   ```

   Output:

   You'll see several lines of output as the cluster and worker nodes are created\. The last line of output is similar to the following example line\.

   ```
   [✓]  EKS cluster "prod" in "us-west-2" region is ready
   ```

------
#### [ Cluster with Linux and Windows workloads ]

   Familiarize yourself with the Windows support [considerations](windows-support.md#considerations), which include supported values for `instanceType` in the example text below\. Replace the example *values* with your own values\.

   We recommend that you deploy version *1\.16*\. If you must deploy an earlier version, then you can only replace it with version `1.14` or `1.15`\. If you change *1\.16*, then read the important [Amazon EKS release notes](kubernetes-versions.md) for the version and install the corresponding version of [`kubectl`](install-kubectl.md)\.

   Save the text below to a file named `cluster-spec.yaml`\. The configuration file is used to create a cluster with a managed Linux worker node group and a Windows self\-managed worker node group\. Even if you only want to run Windows workloads in your cluster, all Amazon EKS clusters must contain at least one Linux worker node\. We recommend that you create at least two worker nodes in each node group for availability purposes\. 

   ```
   ---
   apiVersion: eksctl.io/v1alpha5
   kind: ClusterConfig
   
   metadata:
     name: windows-prod
     region: us-west-2
     version: '1.16'  
   managedNodeGroups:
     - name: linux-ng
       instanceType: t2.large
       minSize: 2
   
   nodeGroups:
     - name: windows-ng
       instanceType: m5.large
       minSize: 2
       volumeSize: 100
       amiFamily: WindowsServer2019FullContainer
   ```

   Create your Amazon EKS cluster and Windows and Linux worker nodes with the following command\.

   ```
   eksctl create cluster -f cluster-spec.yaml --install-vpc-controllers
   ```

**Note**  
For more information on the available options for eksctl create cluster, see the project [README on GitHub](https://github.com/weaveworks/eksctl/blob/master/README.md) or view the help page with the following command\.  

   ```
   eksctl create cluster --help
   ```

   Output:

   You'll see several lines of output as the cluster and worker nodes are created\. The last line of output is similar to the following example line\.

   ```
   [✓]  EKS cluster "windows-prod" in "region-code" region is ready
   ```

------

1. Cluster provisioning usually takes between 10 and 15 minutes\. When your cluster is ready, test that your `kubectl` configuration is correct\. 

   ```
   kubectl get svc
   ```
**Note**  
If you receive any authorization or resource type errors, see [Unauthorized or access denied \(`kubectl`\)](troubleshooting.md#unauthorized) in the troubleshooting section\.

   Output:

   ```
   NAME             TYPE        CLUSTER-IP   EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)   AGE
   svc/kubernetes   ClusterIP   10.100.0.1   <none>        443/TCP   1m
   ```

1. \(Linux accelerated AMI workers only\) If you chose an accelerated AMI instance type and the Amazon EKS\-optimized accelerated AMI , then you must apply the [NVIDIA device plugin for Kubernetes](https://github.com/NVIDIA/k8s-device-plugin) as a DaemonSet on your cluster with the following command\.

   ```
   kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NVIDIA/k8s-device-plugin/1.0.0-beta/nvidia-device-plugin.yml
   ```
