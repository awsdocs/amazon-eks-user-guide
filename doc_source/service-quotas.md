# Amazon EKS service quotas<a name="service-quotas"></a>

Amazon EKS has integrated with Service Quotas, an AWS service that enables you to view and manage your quotas from a central location\. For more information, see [What Is Service Quotas?](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas/latest/userguide/intro.html) in the *Service Quotas User Guide*\. Service Quotas makes it easy to look up the value of your Amazon EKS and AWS Fargate service quotas using the AWS Management Console and AWS CLI\.<a name="service-quotas-console"></a>

**To view Amazon EKS and Fargate service quotas using the AWS Management Console**

1. Open the Service Quotas console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/servicequotas/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas/)\.

1. In the navigation panel, choose **AWS services**\.

1. From the **AWS services** list, search for and select **Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service \(Amazon EKS\)** or **AWS Fargate**\.

   In the **Service quotas** list, you can see the service quota name, applied value \(if it is available\), AWS default quota, and whether the quota value is adjustable\.

1. To view additional information about a service quota, such as the description, choose the quota name\.

1. \(Optional\) To request a quota increase, select the quota that you want to increase, select **Request quota increase**, enter or select the required information, and select **Request**\.

To work more with service quotas using the AWS Management Console see the [Service Quotas User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas/latest/userguide/intro.html)\. To request a quota increase, see [Requesting a Quota Increase](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas/latest/userguide/request-quota-increase.html) in the *Service Quotas User Guide*\.

**To view Amazon EKS and Fargate service quotas using the AWS CLI**  
Run the following command to view your Amazon EKS quotas\.

```
aws service-quotas list-aws-default-service-quotas \
    --query 'Quotas[*].{Adjustable:Adjustable,Name:QuotaName,Value:Value,Code:QuotaCode}' \
    --service-code eks \
    --output table
```

Run the following command to view your Fargate quotas\.

```
aws service-quotas list-aws-default-service-quotas \
    --query 'Quotas[*].{Adjustable:Adjustable,Name:QuotaName,Value:Value,Code:QuotaCode}' \
    --service-code fargate \
    --output table
```

**Note**  
The quota returned is the maximum number of Amazon ECS tasks or Amazon EKS pods running concurrently on Fargate in this account in the current Region\.

To work more with service quotas using the AWS CLI, see the [Service Quotas AWS CLI Command Reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/service-quotas/index.html#cli-aws-service-quotas)\. To request a quota increase, see the [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/service-quotas/request-service-quota-increase.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/service-quotas/request-service-quota-increase.html) command in the [AWS CLI Command Reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/service-quotas/index.html#cli-aws-service-quotas)\.
