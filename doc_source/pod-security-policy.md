# Pod Security Policy<a name="pod-security-policy"></a>

The Kubernetes pod security policy admission controller validates pod creation and update requests against a set of rules\. By default, Amazon EKS clusters ship with a fully permissive security policy with no restrictions\. For more information, see [Pod Security Policies](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/policy/pod-security-policy/) in the Kubernetes documentation\.

**Note**  
The pod security policy admission controller is only enabled on Amazon EKS clusters running Kubernetes version 1\.13 or later\. You must update your cluster's Kubernetes version to at least 1\.13 to use pod security policies\. For more information, see [Updating an Amazon EKS Cluster Kubernetes Version](update-cluster.md)\.

## Amazon EKS Default Pod Security Policy<a name="default-psp"></a>

Amazon EKS clusters with Kubernetes version 1\.13 and higher have a default pod security policy named `eks.privileged`\. This policy has no restriction on what kind of pod can be accepted into the system, which is equivalent to running Kubernetes with the `PodSecurityPolicy` controller disabled\.

**Note**  
This policy was created to maintain backwards compatibility with clusters that did not have the `PodSecurityPolicy` controller enabled\. You can create more restrictive policies for your cluster and for individual namespaces and service accounts and then delete the default policy to enable the more restrictive policies\.

You can view the default policy with the following command\.

```
kubectl get psp eks.privileged
```

Output:

```
NAME             PRIV   CAPS   SELINUX    RUNASUSER   FSGROUP    SUPGROUP   READONLYROOTFS   VOLUMES
eks.privileged   true   *      RunAsAny   RunAsAny    RunAsAny   RunAsAny   false            *
```

For more details, you can describe the policy with the following command\.

```
kubectl describe psp eks.privileged
```

Output:

```

    Type:                                 <none>

  Supplemental Groups Strategy: RunAsAny
    Ranges:                               <none>
```

The following example shows the full YAML file for the `eks.privileged` pod security policy, its cluster role, and cluster role binding\.

**To delete the default pod security policy**

After you create custom pod security policies for your cluster, you can delete the default Amazon EKS `eks.privileged` pod security policy to enable your custom policies\.

1. Create a file called `privileged-podsecuritypolicy.yaml` and paste the full `eks.privileged` YAML file contents from the preceding example into it \(this allows you to delete the pod security policy, the `ClusterRole`, and the `ClusterRoleBinding` associated with it\)\.

1. Delete the YAML with the following command\.

   ```
   kubectl delete -f privileged-podsecuritypolicy.yaml
   ```<a name="install-default-psp"></a>

**To install or restore the default pod security policy**

If you are upgrading from an earlier version of Kubernetes, or have modified or deleted the default Amazon EKS `eks.privileged` pod security policy, you can restore it with the following steps\.

1. Create a file called `privileged-podsecuritypolicy.yaml` and paste the YAML file contents below into it\.

   ```
