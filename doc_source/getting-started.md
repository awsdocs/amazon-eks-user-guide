# Getting Started with Amazon EKS<a name="getting-started"></a>

There are two getting started guides available for creating a new Kubernetes cluster with worker nodes in Amazon EKS:
+ [Getting Started with `eksctl`](getting-started-eksctl.md): This getting started guide helps you to install all of the required resources to get started with Amazon EKS using `eksctl`, a simple command line utility for creating and managing Kubernetes clusters on Amazon EKS\. At the end of this tutorial, you will have a running Amazon EKS cluster with worker nodes, and the `kubectl` command line utility will be configured to use your new cluster\. This is the fastest and simplest way to get started with Amazon EKS\.

+ [Getting Started with the AWS Management Console](getting-started-console.md): This getting started guide helps you to create all of the required resources to get started with Amazon EKS in the AWS Management Console\. In this guide, you manually create each resource in the Amazon EKS or AWS CloudFormation consoles, and the workflow described here gives you complete visibility into how each resource is created and how they interact with each other\.
