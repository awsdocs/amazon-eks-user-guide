Many procedures of this user guide use the following command line tools:
+ **`kubectl`** – A command line tool for working with Kubernetes clusters\. For more information, see [Installing `kubectl`](install-kubectl.md)\.
+ **`eksctl`** – A command line tool for working with EKS clusters that automates many individual tasks\. For more information, see [Installing `eksctl`](eksctl.md)\.
+ **AWS CLI** – A command line tool for working with AWS services, including Amazon EKS\. For more information, see [Installing, updating, and uninstalling the AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-install.html) in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide\. After installing the AWS CLI, we recommend that you also configure it\. For more information, see [Quick configuration with `aws configure`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-quickstart.html#cli-configure-quickstart-config) in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide\.

There are two getting started guides available for creating a new Kubernetes cluster with nodes in Amazon EKS:
+ [Getting started with Amazon EKS – `eksctl`](getting-started-eksctl.md) – This getting started guide helps you to install all of the required resources to get started with Amazon EKS using `eksctl`, a simple command line utility for creating and managing Kubernetes clusters on Amazon EKS\. At the end of the tutorial, you will have a running Amazon EKS cluster that you can deploy applications to\. This is the fastest and simplest way to get started with Amazon EKS\.
+ [Getting started with Amazon EKS – AWS Management Console and AWS CLI](getting-started-console.md) – This getting started guide helps you to create all of the required resources to get started with Amazon EKS using the AWS Management Console and AWS CLI\. At the end of the tutorial, you will have a running Amazon EKS cluster that you can deploy applications to\. In this guide, you manually create each resource required for an Amazon EKS cluster\. The procedures give you visibility into how each resource is created and how they interact with each other\.
