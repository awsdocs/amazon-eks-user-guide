# AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry \(ADOT\) prerequisites<a name="adot-reqts"></a>

Before installing the AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry \(ADOT\) add\-on, you must meet the following prerequisites\.
+ Grant permissions to Amazon EKS add\-ons to install ADOT:

  ```
  kubectl apply -f https://amazon-eks.s3.amazonaws.com/docs/addons-otel-permissions.yaml
  ```
+ Your Amazon EKS cluster must be using Kubernetes version `1.19` or higher\. You can verify the version using the following command\. To update your cluster, see [Updating an Amazon EKS cluster Kubernetes version](update-cluster.md)\.

  ```
  kubectl version | grep "Server Version"
  ```
+ Meet the [TLS certificate requirement](#adot-reqtcr) to ensure end\-to\-end encryption\.

## TLS certificate requirement<a name="adot-reqtcr"></a>

The ADOT Operator uses [admission webhooks](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/webhook/) to mutate and validate the Collector Custom Resource \(CR\) requests\. In Kubernetes, the webhook requires a TLS certificate that the API server is configured to trust\. There are multiple ways for you to generate the required TLS certificate\. However, the default method is to install the [cert\-manager](https://cert-manager.io/docs/) manually with a version of *less than `1.6.0`*\. The cert\-manager generates a self\-signed certificate\.

**Important**  
The ADOT Operator is compatible with cert\-manager versions of less than `1.6.0`\. Don't use version `1.6.0`\.

### Installing cert\-manager<a name="adot-reqtcrsteps"></a>

**Installing cert\-manager**

1. Install cert\-manager using the following command\. This creates the necessary cert\-manager objects that allow end\-to\-end encryption\. This must be done for each cluster that will have ADOT installed\.

   ```
   kubectl apply -f \ 
   https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager/releases/download/v1.8.2/cert-manager.yaml
   ```

1. Verify that cert\-manager is ready using the following command\.

   ```
   kubectl get pod -w -n cert-manager
   ```

   The example output is as follows\.

   ```
   NAME READY  STATUS RESTARTS  AGE
   cert-manager-5597cff495-mnb2p  1/1  Running  0 12d
   cert-manager-cainjector-bd5f9c764-8jp5g  1/1  Running  0 12d
   cert-manager-webhook-5f57f59fbc-h9st8  1/1  Running  0 12d
   ```
