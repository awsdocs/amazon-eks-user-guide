# Launching Amazon EKS Linux Worker Nodes<a name="launch-workers"></a>

This topic helps you to launch an Auto Scaling group of Linux worker nodes that register with your Amazon EKS cluster\. After the nodes join the cluster, you can deploy Kubernetes applications to them\.

If this is your first time launching Amazon EKS Linux worker nodes, we recommend that you follow one of our [Getting Started with Amazon EKS](getting-started.md) guides instead\. The guides provide complete end\-to\-end walkthroughs for creating an Amazon EKS cluster with worker nodes\.

**Important**  
Amazon EKS worker nodes are standard Amazon EC2 instances, and you are billed for them based on normal Amazon EC2 prices\. For more information, see [Amazon EC2 Pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/)\.

Choose the tab below that corresponds to your desired worker node creation method:

------
#### [ Amazon EKS Managed Node Groups ]

[Managed Node Groups](managed-node-groups.md) are supported on Amazon EKS clusters beginning with Kubernetes version 1\.14 and [platform version](platform-versions.md) `eks.3`\. Existing clusters can update to version 1\.14 to take advantage of this feature\. For more information, see [Updating an Amazon EKS Cluster Kubernetes Version](update-cluster.md)\. Existing 1\.14 clusters will be automatically updated to `eks.3` over time to support this feature\.

**To launch your managed node group**

1. Wait for your cluster status to show as `ACTIVE`\. You cannot create a managed node group for a cluster that is not yet `ACTIVE`\.

1. Open the Amazon EKS console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/eks/home\#/clusters](https://console.aws.amazon.com/eks/home#/clusters)\.

1. Choose the name of the cluster that you want to create your managed node group in\.

1. On the cluster page, choose **Add node group**\.

1. On the **Configure node group** page, fill out the parameters accordingly, and then choose **Next**\.
   + **Name** — Enter a unique name for your managed node group\.
   + **Node IAM role name** — Choose the node instance role to use with your node group\. For more information, see [Amazon EKS Worker Node IAM Role](worker_node_IAM_role.md)\.
   + **Subnets** — Choose the subnets to launch your managed nodes into\. 
**Important**  
If you are running a stateful application across multiple Availability Zones that is backed by Amazon EBS volumes and using the Kubernetes [Cluster Autoscaler](cluster-autoscaler.md), you should configure multiple node groups, each scoped to a single Availability Zone\. In addition, you should enable the `--balance-similar-node-groups` feature\.
   + **Remote Access** — \(Optional\) You can enable SSH access to the nodes in your managed node group\. This allows you to connect to your instances and gather diagnostic information if there are issues\. Complete the following steps to enable remote access\.
**Note**  
We highly recommend enabling remote access when you create your node group\. You cannot enable remote access after the node group is created\.

     1. Select the check box to **Allow remote access to nodes**\.

     1. For **SSH key pair**, choose an Amazon EC2 SSH key to use\. For more information, see [Amazon EC2 Key Pairs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-key-pairs.html) in the Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances\.

     1. For **Allow remote access from**, choose **All** to allow SSH access from anywhere on the Internet \(0\.0\.0\.0/0\), or select a security group to allow SSH access from instances that belong to that security group\.
   + **Tags** — \(Optional\) You can choose to tag your Amazon EKS managed node group\. These tags do not propagate to other resources in the node group, such as Auto Scaling groups or instances\. For more information, see [Tagging Your Amazon EKS Resources](eks-using-tags.md)\.
   + **Kubernetes labels** — \(Optional\) You can choose to apply Kubernetes labels to the nodes in your managed node group\.

1. On the **Set compute configuration** page, fill out the parameters accordingly, and then choose **Next**\.
   + **AMI type** — Choose **Amazon Linux 2 \(AL2\_x86\_64\)** for non\-GPU instances, or **Amazon Linux 2 GPU Enabled \(AL2\_x86\_64\_GPU\)** for GPU instances\.
   + **Instance type** — Choose the instance type to use in your managed node group\. Larger instance types can accommodate more pods\.
   + **Disk size** — Enter the disk size \(in GiB\) to use for your worker node root volume\.

1. On the **Setup scaling policies** page, fill out the parameters accordingly, and then choose **Next**\.
**Note**  
Amazon EKS does not automatically scale your node group in or out\. However, you can configure the Kubernetes [Cluster Autoscaler](cluster-autoscaler.md) to do this for you\.
   + **Minimum size** — Specify the minimum number of worker nodes that the managed node group can scale in to\.
   + **Maximum size** — Specify the maximum number of worker nodes that the managed node group can scale out to\.
   + **Desired size** — Specify the current number of worker nodes that the managed node group should maintain at launch\.

1. On the **Review and create** page, review your managed node group configuration and choose **Create**\.

1. Watch the status of your nodes and wait for them to reach the `Ready` status\.

   ```
   kubectl get nodes --watch
   ```

1. \(GPU workers only\) If you chose a GPU instance type and the Amazon EKS\-optimized AMI with GPU support, you must apply the [NVIDIA device plugin for Kubernetes](https://github.com/NVIDIA/k8s-device-plugin) as a DaemonSet on your cluster with the following command\.

   ```
   kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NVIDIA/k8s-device-plugin/1.0.0-beta/nvidia-device-plugin.yml
   ```

#### [ eksctl ]

**To launch worker nodes with `eksctl`**

This procedure assumes that you have installed `eksctl`, and that your `eksctl` version is at least `0.11.0`\. You can check your version with the following command:

```
eksctl version
```

 For more information on installing or upgrading `eksctl`, see [Installing or Upgrading `eksctl`](eksctl.md#installing-eksctl)\.
**Note**  
This procedure only works for clusters that were created with `eksctl`\.

1. Create your worker node group with the following command\. Replace the *example values* with your own values\.

   ```
   eksctl create nodegroup \
   --cluster default \
   --version auto \
   --name standard-workers \
   --node-type t3.medium \
   --node-ami auto \
   --nodes 3 \
   --nodes-min 1 \
   --nodes-max 4
   ```
**Note**  
For more information on the available options for eksctl create nodegroup, see the project [README on GitHub](https://github.com/weaveworks/eksctl/blob/master/README.md) or view the help page with the following command\.  

   ```
   eksctl create nodegroup --help
   ```

   Output:

   ```

#### [ Unmanaged nodes ]

These procedures have the following prerequisites:
+ You have created a VPC and security group that meet the requirements for an Amazon EKS cluster\. For more information, see [Cluster VPC Considerations](network_reqs.md) and [Amazon EKS Security Group Considerations](sec-group-reqs.md)\. The [Getting Started with Amazon EKS](getting-started.md) guide creates a VPC that meets the requirements, or you can also follow [Creating a VPC for Your Amazon EKS Cluster](create-public-private-vpc.md) to create one manually\.
+ You have created an Amazon EKS cluster and specified that it use the VPC and security group that meet the requirements of an Amazon EKS cluster\. For more information, see [Creating an Amazon EKS Cluster](create-cluster.md)\.

**To launch your unmanaged worker nodes with the AWS Management Console**

1. Wait for your cluster status to show as `ACTIVE`\. If you launch your worker nodes before the cluster is active, the worker nodes will fail to register with the cluster and you will have to relaunch them\.

1. Choose the tab below that corresponds to your cluster's Kubernetes version, then choose a **Launch workers** link that corresponds to your region and AMI type\. This opens the AWS CloudFormation console and pre\-populates several fields for you\.

------
#### [ Kubernetes version 1\.14\.7 ]    
[\[See the AWS documentation website for more details\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/launch-workers.html)

------
#### [ Kubernetes version 1\.13\.11 ]    
[\[See the AWS documentation website for more details\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/launch-workers.html)

------
#### [ Kubernetes version 1\.12\.10 ]    
[\[See the AWS documentation website for more details\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/launch-workers.html)

------
**Note**  
If you intend to only deploy worker nodes to private subnets, you should edit this template in the AWS CloudFormation designer and modify the `AssociatePublicIpAddress` parameter in the `NodeLaunchConfig` to be `false`\.  

   ```
   AssociatePublicIpAddress: 'false'
   ```

1. On the **Quick create stack** page, fill out the following parameters accordingly:
   + **Stack name**: Choose a stack name for your AWS CloudFormation stack\. For example, you can call it ***<cluster\-name>*\-worker\-nodes**\.
   + **ClusterName**: Enter the name that you used when you created your Amazon EKS cluster\.
**Important**  
This name must exactly match the name you used in [Step 1: Create Your Amazon EKS Cluster](getting-started-console.md#eks-create-cluster); otherwise, your worker nodes cannot join the cluster\.
   + **ClusterControlPlaneSecurityGroup**: Choose the **SecurityGroups** value from the AWS CloudFormation output that you generated with [Create your Amazon EKS Cluster VPC](getting-started-console.md#vpc-create)\.
   + **NodeGroupName**: Enter a name for your node group\. This name can be used later to identify the Auto Scaling node group that is created for your worker nodes\.
   + **NodeAutoScalingGroupMinSize**: Enter the minimum number of nodes that your worker node Auto Scaling group can scale in to\.
   + **NodeAutoScalingGroupDesiredCapacity**: Enter the desired number of nodes to scale to when your stack is created\.
   + **NodeAutoScalingGroupMaxSize**: Enter the maximum number of nodes that your worker node Auto Scaling group can scale out to\.
   + **NodeInstanceType**: Choose an instance type for your worker nodes\.
**Note**  
The supported instance types for the latest version of the [Amazon VPC CNI plugin for Kubernetes](https://github.com/aws/amazon-vpc-cni-k8s) are shown [here](https://github.com/aws/amazon-vpc-cni-k8s/blob/release-1.5/pkg/awsutils/vpc_ip_resource_limit.go)\. You may need to update your CNI version to take advantage of the latest supported instance types\. For more information, see [Amazon VPC CNI Plugin for Kubernetes Upgrades](cni-upgrades.md)\.
**Important**  
Some instance types might not be available in all regions\.
   + **NodeImageIdSSMParam**: Pre\-populated based on the version that you launched your worker nodes with in step 2\. This value is the Amazon EC2 Systems Manager Parameter Store parameter to use for your worker node AMI ID\. For example, the `/aws/service/eks/optimized-ami/1.14/amazon-linux-2/recommended/image_id` parameter is for the latest recommended Kubernetes version 1\.14 Amazon EKS\-optimized AMI\. 
**Note**  
The Amazon EKS worker node AMI is based on Amazon Linux 2\. You can track security or privacy events for Amazon Linux 2 at the [Amazon Linux Security Center](https://alas.aws.amazon.com/alas2.html) or subscribe to the associated [RSS feed](https://alas.aws.amazon.com/AL2/alas.rss)\. Security and privacy events include an overview of the issue, what packages are affected, and how to update your instances to correct the issue\.
   + **NodeImageId**: \(Optional\) If you are using your own custom AMI \(instead of the Amazon EKS\-optimized AMI\), enter a worker node AMI ID for your Region\. If you specify a value here, it overrides any values in the **NodeImageIdSSMParam** field\. 
   + **NodeVolumeSize**: Specify a root volume size for your worker nodes, in GiB\.
   + **KeyName**: Enter the name of an Amazon EC2 SSH key pair that you can use to connect using SSH into your worker nodes with after they launch\. If you don't already have an Amazon EC2 keypair, you can create one in the AWS Management Console\. For more information, see [Amazon EC2 Key Pairs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-key-pairs.html) in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances*\.
**Note**  
If you do not provide a keypair here, the AWS CloudFormation stack creation fails\.
   + **BootstrapArguments**: Specify any optional arguments to pass to the worker node bootstrap script, such as extra kubelet arguments\. For more information, view the bootstrap script usage information at [https://github\.com/awslabs/amazon\-eks\-ami/blob/master/files/bootstrap\.sh](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-eks-ami/blob/master/files/bootstrap.sh)\. 
   + **VpcId**: Enter the ID for the VPC that you created in [Create your Amazon EKS Cluster VPC](getting-started-console.md#vpc-create)\.
   + **Subnets**: Choose the subnets that you created in [Create your Amazon EKS Cluster VPC](getting-started-console.md#vpc-create)\. If you created your VPC using the steps described at [Creating a VPC for Your Amazon EKS Cluster](create-public-private-vpc.md), then specify only the private subnets within the VPC for your worker nodes to launch into\.

1. Acknowledge that the stack might create IAM resources, and then choose **Create stack**\.

1. When your stack has finished creating, select it in the console and choose **Outputs**\.

1. Record the **NodeInstanceRole** for the node group that was created\. You need this when you configure your Amazon EKS worker nodes\.

**To enable worker nodes to join your cluster**

1. Download, edit, and apply the AWS IAM Authenticator configuration map\.

   1. Use the following command to download the configuration map:

      ```
      curl -o aws-auth-cm.yaml https://amazon-eks.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/cloudformation/2019-11-15/aws-auth-cm.yaml
      ```

   1. Open the file with your favorite text editor\. Replace the *<ARN of instance role \(not instance profile\)>* snippet with the **NodeInstanceRole** value that you recorded in the previous procedure, and save the file\.
**Important**  
Do not modify any other lines in this file\.

      ```
      apiVersion: v1
      kind: ConfigMap
      metadata:
        name: aws-auth
        namespace: kube-system
      data:
        mapRoles: |
          - rolearn: <ARN of instance role (not instance profile)>
            username: system:node:{{EC2PrivateDNSName}}
            groups:
              - system:bootstrappers
              - system:nodes
      ```

   1. Apply the configuration\. This command may take a few minutes to finish\.

      ```
      kubectl apply -f aws-auth-cm.yaml
      ```
**Note**  
If you receive the error `"aws-iam-authenticator": executable file not found in $PATH`, your kubectl isn't configured for Amazon EKS\. For more information, see [Installing `aws-iam-authenticator`](install-aws-iam-authenticator.md)\.  
If you receive any other authorization or resource type errors, see [Unauthorized or Access Denied \(`kubectl`\)](troubleshooting.md#unauthorized) in the troubleshooting section\.

1. Watch the status of your nodes and wait for them to reach the `Ready` status\.

   ```
   kubectl get nodes --watch
   ```

1. \(GPU workers only\) If you chose a GPU instance type and the Amazon EKS\-optimized AMI with GPU support, you must apply the [NVIDIA device plugin for Kubernetes](https://github.com/NVIDIA/k8s-device-plugin) as a DaemonSet on your cluster with the following command\.

   ```
   kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NVIDIA/k8s-device-plugin/1.0.0-beta/nvidia-device-plugin.yml
   ```

1. \(Optional\) [Launch a Guest Book Application](eks-guestbook.md) — Deploy a sample application to test your cluster and Linux worker nodes\.
