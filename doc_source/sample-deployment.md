# Deploy a sample application<a name="sample-deployment"></a>

In this topic, you deploy a sample application to your cluster\.

**Prerequisites**
+ An existing Kubernetes cluster\. If you don't have an existing Amazon EKS cluster, you can deploy one using one of the [Getting started with Amazon EKS](getting-started.md) guides\. If you're deploying a Windows application, then you must have [Windows support](windows-support.md) enabled for your cluster and at least one Amazon EC2 Windows node\.
+ `Kubectl` installed on your computer\. For more information, see [Installing `kubectl`](install-kubectl.md)\.
+ `Kubectl` configured to communicate with your cluster\. For more information, see [Create a `kubeconfig` for Amazon EKS](create-kubeconfig.md)\.
+ If you plan to deploy your sample workload to Fargate, then you must have an existing [Fargate profile](fargate-profile.md) that includes the same namespace created in this tutorial, which is `eks-sample-app`, unless you change the name\. If you used one of the [getting started guides](getting-started.md) to create your cluster, then you'll have to create a new profile, or add the namespace to your existing profile, because the profile created in the getting started guides doesn't specify the namespace used in this tutorial\. Your VPC must also have at least one private subnet\.

**To deploy a sample application**

Though many variables are changeable in the following steps, we recommend only changing variable values where specified\. Once you have a better understanding of Kubernetes Pods, Deployments, and Services, you can experiment with changing other values\.

1. Create a namespace\. A namespace allows you to group resources in Kubernetes\. For more information, see [Namespaces](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/namespaces/) in the Kubernetes documentation\. If you plan to deploy your sample application to [AWS Fargate](fargate.md), make sure that the value for `namespace` in your [AWS Fargate profile](fargate-profile.md) is `eks-sample-app`\.

   ```
   kubectl create namespace eks-sample-app
   ```

1. Create a Kubernetes Deployment\. This sample Deployment pulls a container image from a public repository and deploys three replicas \(individual Pods\) of it to your cluster\. To learn more, see [Deployments](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/) in the Kubernetes documentation\. You can deploy the application to Linux or Windows nodes\. If you're deploying to Fargate, then you can only deploy a Linux application\.

   1. Save the following contents to a file named `eks-sample-deployment.yaml`\. The containers in the sample application don't use network storage, but you might have applications that need to\. For more information, see [Storage](storage.md)\.

------
#### [ Linux ]

      The `amd64` or `arm64` `values` under the `kubernetes.io/arch` key mean that the application can be deployed to either hardware architecture \(if you have both in your cluster\)\. This is possible because this image is a multi\-architecture image, but not all are\. You can determine the hardware architecture that the image is supported on by viewing the [image details](https://gallery.ecr.aws/nginx/nginx) in the repository that you're pulling it from\. When deploying images that don't support a hardware architecture type, or that you don't want the image deployed to, remove that type from the manifest\. For more information, see [Well\-Known Labels, Annotations and Taints](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/labels-annotations-taints/) in the Kubernetes documentation\.

      The `kubernetes.io/os: linux` `nodeSelector` means that if you had Linux and Windows nodes \(for example\) in your cluster, the image would only be deployed to Linux nodes\. For more information, see [Well\-Known Labels, Annotations and Taints](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/labels-annotations-taints/) in the Kubernetes documentation\.

      ```

------
#### [ Windows ]

      The `kubernetes.io/os: windows` `nodeSelector` means that if you had Windows and Linux nodes \(for example\) in your cluster, the image would only be deployed to Windows nodes\. For more information, see [Well\-Known Labels, Annotations and Taints](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/labels-annotations-taints/) in the Kubernetes documentation\.

            nodeSelector:
              kubernetes.io/os: windows
      ```

------

   1. Apply the Deployment manifest to your cluster\.

      ```
      kubectl apply -f eks-sample-deployment.yaml
      ```

1. Create a Service\. A Service allows you to access all replicas through a single IP address or name\. For more information, see [Service](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/) in the Kubernetes documentation\. Though not implemented in the sample application, if you have applications that need to interact with other AWS services, we recommend that you create Kubernetes service accounts for your pods, and associate them to AWS IAM accounts\. By specifying service accounts, your Pods have only the minimum permissions that you specify for them to interact with other services\. For more information, see [IAM roles for service accounts](iam-roles-for-service-accounts.md)\.

   1. Save the following contents to a file named `eks-sample-service.yaml`\. Kubernetes assigns the Service its own IP address that is accessible only from within the cluster\. To access the Service from outside of your cluster, deploy the [AWS Load Balancer Controller](aws-load-balancer-controller.md) to load balance [application](alb-ingress.md) or [network](network-load-balancing.md) traffic to the service\.

          - protocol: TCP
            port: 80
            targetPort: 80
      ```

------
#### [ Windows ]

      ```
      apiVersion: v1
      kind: Service
      metadata:
        name: eks-sample-windows-service
        namespace: eks-sample-app
        labels:
          app: eks-sample-windows-app
      spec:
        selector:
          app: eks-sample-windows-app
        ports:
          - protocol: TCP
            port: 80
            targetPort: 80
      ```

------

   1. Apply the Service manifest to your cluster\.

      ```
      kubectl apply -f eks-sample-service.yaml
      ```

1. <a name="sample-app-view-namespace"></a>View all resources that exist in the `eks-sample-app` namespace\.

   ```
   kubectl get all -n eks-sample-app
   ```

   Output

   If you deployed Windows resources, then all instances of `linux` in the following output are `windows`\. The other *example values* may be different from your output\.

   ```
   NAME                                               READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE

   NAME                                                      DESIRED   CURRENT   READY   AGE
   replicaset.apps/eks-sample-linux-deployment-776d8f8fd8    3         3         3       27m
   ```

   In the output, you see the Service and Deployment that were specified in the sample manifests deployed in previous steps\. You also see three Pods\. This is because `3` `replicas` were specified in the sample manifest\. For more information about Pods, see [Pods](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod/) in the Kubernetes documentation\. Kubernetes automatically creates the `replicaset` resource, even though it isn't specified in the sample manifests\. For more information about ReplicaSets, see [ReplicaSet](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/replicaset/) in the Kubernetes documentation\.
**Note**  
Kubernetes maintains the number of replicas that are specified in the manifest\. If this were a production deployment and you wanted Kubernetes to horizontally scale the number of replicas or vertically scale the compute resources for the pods, use the [Horizontal Pod Autoscaler](horizontal-pod-autoscaler.md) and the [Vertical Pod Autoscaler](vertical-pod-autoscaler.md) to do so\.

1. View the details of the deployed Service\. If you deployed a Windows service, replace *linux* with **windows**\.

   ```
   kubectl -n eks-sample-app describe service eks-sample-linux-service
   ```

   Output

   If you deployed Windows resources, then all instances of `linux` in the following output are `windows`\. The other *example values* may be different from your output\.

   ```
   Name:              eks-sample-linux-service
   Namespace:         eks-sample-app
   Labels:            app=eks-sample-linux-app
   Annotations:       <none>
   Selector:          app=eks-sample-linux-app
   Type:              ClusterIP
   IP Families:       <none>
   IP:                10.100.74.8
   IPs:               10.100.74.8
   Port:              <unset>  80/TCP
   TargetPort:        80/TCP
   Endpoints:         192.168.24.212:80,192.168.50.185:80,192.168.63.93:80
   Session Affinity:  None
   Events:            <none>
   ```

   In the previous output, the value for `IP:` is a unique IP address that can be reached from any node or Pod within the cluster, but it can't be reached from outside of the cluster\. The values for `Endpoints` are IP addresses assigned from within your VPC to the Pods that are part of the Service\.

1. View the details of one of the Pods listed in the output when you [viewed the namespace](#sample-app-view-namespace) in a previous step\. If you deployed a Windows app, replace *linux* with **windows** and replace *776d8f8fd8\-78w66* with the value returned for one of your Pods\.

   ```
   kubectl -n eks-sample-app describe pod eks-sample-linux-deployment-65b7669776-m6qxz
   ```

   Abbreviated output

   If you deployed Windows resources, then all instances of `linux` in the following output are `windows`\. The other *example values* may be different from your output\.

   ```

   ...
   ```

   In the previous output, the value for `IP:` is a unique IP that's assigned to the pod from the CIDR block assigned to the subnet that the node is in\. If you prefer to assign Pods IP addresses from different CIDR blocks, you can change the default behavior\. For more information, see [CNI custom networking](cni-custom-network.md)\. You can also see that the Kubernetes scheduler scheduled the Pod on the `Node` with the IP address *`192.168.45.132`*\.
**Tip**  
Rather than using the command line, you can view many details about Pods, Services, Deployments, and other Kubernetes resources in the AWS Management Console\. For more information, see [View workloads](view-workloads.md)\.

1. Run a shell on the Pod that you described in the previous step, replacing *65b7669776\-m6qxz* with the ID of one of your Pods\.

------
#### [ Linux ]

   ```
   kubectl exec -it eks-sample-linux-deployment-65b7669776-m6qxz -n eks-sample-app -- /bin/bash
   ```

------
#### [ Windows ]

   ```
   kubectl exec -it eks-sample-windows-deployment-65b7669776-m6qxz -n eks-sample-app -- powershell.exe
   ```

------

1. From the Pod shell, view the output from the web server that was installed with your Deployment in a previous step\. You only need to specify the Service name\. It is resolved to the Service's IP address by CoreDNS, which is deployed with an Amazon EKS cluster, by default\.

------
#### [ Linux ]

   ```
   curl eks-sample-linux-service
   ```

   Output

   ```
   <!DOCTYPE html>
   <html>
   <head>
   <title>Welcome to nginx!</title>
   ...
   ```

------
#### [ Windows ]

   ```
   Invoke-WebRequest -uri eks-sample-windows-service/default.html -UseBasicParsing
   ```

   Output

   ```

   ```

------

1. From the Pod shell, view the DNS server for the Pod\.

------
#### [ Linux ]

   ```
   cat /etc/resolv.conf
   ```

   Output

   ```
   nameserver 10.100.0.10
   search eks-sample-app.svc.cluster.local svc.cluster.local cluster.local us-west-2.compute.internal
   options ndots:5
   ```

   In the previous output, `10.100.0.10` is automatically assigned as the `nameserver` for all Pods deployed to the cluster\.

------
#### [ Windows ]

   ```
   Get-NetIPConfiguration
   ```

   Abbreviated output

   ```
   InterfaceAlias       : vEthernet
   ...
   IPv4Address          : 192.168.63.14
   ...
   DNSServer            : 10.100.0.10
   ```

   In the previous output, `10.100.0.10` is automatically assigned as the DNS server for all Pods deployed to the cluster\.

------

1. Disconnect from the Pod by typing `exit`\.

1. Once you're finished with the sample application, you can remove the sample Namespace, Service, and Deployment with the following command\.

   ```
   kubectl delete namespace eks-sample-app
   ```
