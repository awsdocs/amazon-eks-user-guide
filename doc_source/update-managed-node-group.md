# Updating a managed node group<a name="update-managed-node-group"></a>

There are several scenarios where it's useful to update your Amazon EKS managed node group's version or configuration:
+ You have updated the Kubernetes version for your Amazon EKS cluster and want to update your nodes to use the same Kubernetes version\.
+ A new AMI release version is available for your managed node group\. For more information about AMI versions, see [Amazon EKS optimized Amazon Linux AMI versions](eks-linux-ami-versions.md)\.
+ You want to adjust the minimum, maximum, or desired count of the instances in your managed node group\.
+ You want to add or remove Kubernetes labels from the instances in your managed node group\.
+ You want to add or remove AWS tags from your managed node group\.
+ You need to deploy a new version of a launch template with configuration changes, such as an updated custom AMI\.

If there is a newer AMI release version for your managed node group's Kubernetes version, you can update your node group's version to use the newer AMI version\. Similarly, if your cluster is running a Kubernetes version that is newer than your node group, you can update the node group to use the latest AMI release version to match your cluster's Kubernetes version\.

**Note**  
You can't roll back a node group to an earlier Kubernetes version or AMI version\.

When a node in a managed node group is terminated due to a scaling action or update, the pods in that node are drained first\. For more information, see [Managed node update behavior](managed-node-update-behavior.md)\.

## Update a node group version<a name="mng-update"></a>

You can update a node group version with the [AWS Management Console](#update-node-group-version-console) or [`eksctl`](#update-node-group-version-eksctl)\.<a name="update-node-group-version-console"></a>

**To update a node group version with the AWS Management Console**

1. \(Optional\) If you are using the Kubernetes [Cluster Autoscaler](https://github.com/kubernetes/autoscaler/tree/master/cluster-autoscaler), scale the deployment down to zero replicas to avoid conflicting scaling actions\.

   ```
   kubectl scale deployments/cluster-autoscaler --replicas=0 -n kube-system
   ```

1. Open the Amazon EKS console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/eks/home\#/clusters](https://console.aws.amazon.com/eks/home#/clusters)\.

1. Choose the cluster that contains the node group to update\.

1. If at least one of your node groups that was deployed with an Amazon EKS optimized AMI has an update available, you'll see a notification under the cluster name\. The notification lets you know how many of your node groups have an update available\. In the **Node Groups** table on the **Compute** tab, you will see **Update now** to the right of:
   +  The value in the **AMI release version** column for each node group that has an Amazon EKS optimized AMI update available\. If a node group is deployed with a custom AMI, this option won't appear\. If your nodes are deployed with a custom AMI, you should follow these steps to deploy a new updated custom AMI\. First, create a new version of your AMI, then create a new launch template version with the new AMI ID, and last upgrade the nodes to the new version of the launch template\. To do this, select **Update now** for a node group that you want to update\.
   + The value in the **Launch template** column for each node group that is deployed with a launch template\. Select **Update now** for a node group that you want to update the launch template version for\.

   If you select a node group from the table and an update is available for it, you'll receive a notification on the **Node Group configuration** page\. On this page, you can choose **Update now**\.

1. On the **Update Node Group version** page, select:
   + **Update Node Group version** – This option is unavailable if you deployed a custom AMI or your EKS optimized AMI is already currently on the latest version for your cluster\.
   + **Launch template version** – This option is unavailable if the node group is deployed without a launch template\. You can only update the launch template version for a node group that has been deployed with the launch template\. Select the version that you want to update the node group to\. If your node group is configured with a custom AMI, then the version that you select must also specify an AMI\. When you upgrade to a newer version of your launch template, all of your nodes are recycled to match the new configuration of the launch template version specified\.

1. For **Update strategy**, select one of the following options and then choose **Update**\.
   + **Rolling update** – This option respects the pod disruption budgets for your cluster\. Updates fail if there is a pod disruption budget issue that causes Amazon EKS to be unable to gracefully drain the pods that are running on this node group\.
   + **Force update** – This option does not respect pod disruption budgets\. Updates occur regardless of pod distruption budget issues by forcing node restarts to occur\.

1. \(Optional\) If you use the Kubernetes [Cluster Autoscaler](https://github.com/kubernetes/autoscaler/tree/master/cluster-autoscaler), scale the deployment back to your desired number of replicas\.

   ```
   kubectl scale deployments/cluster-autoscaler --replicas=<1> -n kube-system
   ```<a name="update-node-group-version-eksctl"></a>

**To update a node group version with `eksctl`**

1. \(Optional\) If you are using the Kubernetes [Cluster Autoscaler](https://github.com/kubernetes/autoscaler/tree/master/cluster-autoscaler), scale the deployment down to zero replicas to avoid conflicting scaling actions\.

   ```
   kubectl scale deployments/cluster-autoscaler --replicas=0 -n kube-system
   ```

1. Upgrade a managed node group to the latest AMI release of the same Kubernetes version that is currently deployed on the nodes with the following command\.

   ```
   eksctl upgrade nodegroup --name=<node-group-name> --cluster=<cluster-name>
   ```
**Note**  
If you're upgrading a node group that is deployed with a launch template to a new launch template version, add `--launch-template-<version>` to the preceding command\. The launch template must meet the requirements described in [Launch template support](launch-templates.md)\. If the launch template includes a custom AMI, the AMI must meet the requirements in [Using a custom AMI](launch-templates.md#launch-template-custom-ami)\. When you upgrade your node group to a newer version of your launch template, all of your nodes are recycled to match the new configuration of the launch template version that is specified\.  
You can't directly upgrade a node group that is deployed without a launch template to a new launch template version\. Instead, you must deploy a new node group using the launch template to update the node group to a new launch template version\.

   You can upgrade a node group to a version that is one minor release later than the node group's current Kubernetes version, but the version can't be later than the the cluster's Kubernetes version\. For example, if you have a cluster running Kubernetes 1\.17, you can upgrade nodes currently running Kubernetes 1\.16 to version 1\.17 with the following command\.

   ```
   eksctl upgrade nodegroup --name=<node-group-name> --cluster=<cluster-name> --kubernetes-version=<1.17>
   ```

1. \(Optional\) If you use the Kubernetes [Cluster Autoscaler](https://github.com/kubernetes/autoscaler/tree/master/cluster-autoscaler), scale the deployment back to your desired number of replicas\.

   ```
   kubectl scale deployments/cluster-autoscaler --replicas=<1> -n kube-system
   ```

## Edit a node group configuration<a name="mng-edit"></a>

You can modify some of the configurations of a managed node group\.

**To edit a node group configuration**

1. Open the Amazon EKS console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/eks/home\#/clusters](https://console.aws.amazon.com/eks/home#/clusters)\.

1. Choose the cluster that contains the node group to edit\.

1. Select the node group to edit, and choose **Edit**\.

1. \(Optional\) On the **Edit node group** page, edit the **Group configuration**\.
   + **Tags** – Add tags to or remove tags from your node group resource\. These tags are only applied to the Amazon EKS node group\. They do not propagate to other resources, such as subnets or Amazon EC2 instances in the node group\.
   + **Kubernetes labels** – Add or remove Kubernetes labels to the nodes in your node group\. The labels shown here are only the labels that you have applied with Amazon EKS\. Other labels may exist on your nodes that are not shown here\.

1. \(Optional\) On the **Edit node group** page, edit the **Group size**\.
   + **Minimum size** – Specify the current number of nodes that the managed node group should maintain\.
   + **Maximum size** – Specify the maximum number of nodes that the managed node group can scale out to\. Managed node groups can support up to 100 nodes by default\.
   + **Desired size** – Specify the current number of nodes that the managed node group should maintain\.

1. When you are finished editing, choose **Save changes**\.
