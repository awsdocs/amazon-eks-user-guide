# Installing the Kubernetes Metrics Server<a name="metrics-server"></a>

The Kubernetes Metrics Server is an aggregator of resource usage data in your cluster, and it is not deployed by default in Amazon EKS clusters\. For more information, see [Kubernetes Metrics Server](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/metrics-server) on GitHub\. The Metrics Server is commonly used by other Kubernetes add ons, such as the [Horizontal Pod Autoscaler](horizontal-pod-autoscaler.md) or the [Kubernetes Dashboard](dashboard-tutorial.md)\. For more information, see [Resource metrics pipeline](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/debug-application-cluster/resource-metrics-pipeline/) in the Kubernetes documentation\. This topic explains how to deploy the Kubernetes Metrics Server on your Amazon EKS cluster\.

**Important**  
Don't use Metrics Server when you need an accurate source of resource usage metrics or as a monitoring solution\.

**Deploy the Metrics Server**

1. Deploy the Metrics Server with the following command:

   ```
   kubectl apply -f https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/metrics-server/releases/latest/download/components.yaml
   ```

**Note**  
Perform the following steps if your worker nodes don't have access to internet and only download images from ECR\.

1. Modify the manifest\.

   1. View the manifest file or files that you downloaded and note the name of the image\. Download the image locally with the following command\.

      ```
      docker pull image:<tag>
      ```

   1. Tag the image to be pushed to an Amazon Elastic Container Registry repository in China with the following command\.

      ```
      docker tag image:<tag> <aws_account_id>.dkr.ecr.<cn-north-1>.amazonaws.com.cn/image:<tag>
      ```

   1. Push the image to a China Amazon ECR repository with the following command\.

      ```
      docker push image:<tag> <aws_account_id>.dkr.ecr.<cn-north-1>.amazonaws.com.cn/image:<tag>
      ```

   1. Update the Kubernetes manifest file or files to reference the Amazon ECR image URL in your Region\.

1. Verify that the `metrics-server` deployment is running the desired number of pods with the following command\.

   ```
   kubectl get deployment metrics-server -n kube-system
   ```

   Output

   ```
   NAME             READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
   metrics-server   1/1     1            1           6m
   ```
