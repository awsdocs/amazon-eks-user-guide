# Deploy the AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry \(ADOT\) Collector for X\-Ray<a name="configure-xray"></a>

You can deploy the AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry \(ADOT\) Collector to send traces to X\-Ray by applying a YAML configuration file\. This procedure downloads an example YAML file that you can apply to your cluster\.

1. Download the `collector-config-xray.yaml` file to your computer\. You can also [view the file](https://github.com/aws-observability/aws-otel-community/blob/master/sample-configs/operator/collector-config-xray.yaml) on GitHub\.

   ```
   curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aws-observability/aws-otel-community/master/sample-configs/operator/collector-config-xray.yaml
   ```

1. In `collector-config-xray.yaml`, replace the following with your own values:
   + `mode: deployment` \(for more information, see the ADOT Collector [installation instructions](https://aws-otel.github.io/docs/getting-started/operator#step-2-install-adot-collector-as-kubernetes-custom-resource-to-your-eks-cluster) on GitHub\)
   + `serviceAccount: adot-collector`
   + `region: "<YOUR_AWS_REGION>"`

1. Apply the YAML file to your cluster to deploy the ADOT Collector:

   ```
   kubectl apply -f collector-config-xray.yaml
   ```

1. \(Optional\) Verify trace data is being sent to X\-Ray by opening the [X\-Ray console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/xray/home) and select `Traces` from the left menu\. Your trace data should be present\.
