# Amazon EKS compute<a name="eks-compute"></a>

Your Amazon EKS cluster can schedule pods on any combination of [Self\-managed nodes](worker.md), Amazon EKS [Managed node groups](managed-node-groups.md), and [AWS Fargate](fargate.md)\. The following table provides several criteria to evaluate when deciding which options best meets your requirements\. We recommend reviewing this page often because the data in this table changes frequently as new capabilities are introduced to Amazon EKS\.


| Criteria | EKS managed node groups | Self\-managed nodes | AWS Fargate |

| Can run containers that require Windows | No | [Yes](windows-support.md) – Your cluster still requires at least one \(two recommended for availability\) Linux node though\. | No | 
| Can run containers that require Linux | Yes | Yes | Yes | 
| Can run workloads that require the [Inferentia chip](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/inferentia-support.html) | No | [Yes](inferentia-support.md) – Amazon Linux only | No | 
| Can run workloads that require a GPU | [Yes](eks-optimized-ami.md#gpu-ami) – Amazon Linux nodes only | [Yes](eks-optimized-ami.md#gpu-ami) – Amazon Linux only | No |

| Can run AWS [Bottlerocket](http://aws.amazon.com/bottlerocket/) | No | [Yes](launch-node-bottlerocket.md) | No – There is no node\. | 
| Pods share a kernel runtime environment with other pods | Yes – All of your pods on each of your nodes | Yes – All of your pods on each of your nodes | No – Each pod has a dedicated kernel | 
| Pods share CPU, memory, storage, and network resources with other pods\. | Yes – Can result in unused resources on each node |  Yes – Can result in unused resources on each node | No – Each pod has dedicated resources and can be sized independently to maximize resource utilization\.  | 
| Pods can use more hardware and memory than requested in pod specs | Yes – If the pod requires more resources than requested, and resources are available on the node, the pod can use additional resources\. | Yes – If the pod requires more resources than requested, and resources are available on the node, the pod can use additional resources\. | No – The pod can be re\-deployed using a larger vCPU and memory configuration though\. | 
| Must deploy and manage Amazon EC2 instances | [Yes](create-managed-node-group.md) – automated through Amazon EKS if you deployed an Amazon EKS optimized AMI\. If you deployed a custom AMI, then you must update the instance manually\. | Yes – Manual configuration or using Amazon EKS provided AWS CloudFormation templates to deploy [Linux \(x86\)](launch-workers.md), [Linux \(Arm\)](eks-optimized-ami.md#arm-ami), or [Windows](windows-support.md) nodes\. | No | 
| Must secure, maintain, and patch the operating system of Amazon EC2 instances | Yes | Yes | No | 
|  Can provide bootstrap arguments at deployment of a node, such as extra kubelet arguments\. | Yes – Using a [launch template](launch-templates.md) with a custom AMI |  Yes – For more information, view the [bootstrap script usage information](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-eks-ami/blob/master/files/bootstrap.sh) on GitHub\. | No – There is no node\. | 
| Can assign IP addresses to pods from a different CIDR block than the IP address assigned to the node\. | Yes – Using a [launch template](launch-templates.md) with a custom AMI | Yes, using [CNI custom networking](cni-custom-network.md)\. | No – There is no node\. | 
| Can SSH into node | Yes | Yes | No – There is no node host operating system to SSH to\. | 
| Can deploy your own custom AMI to nodes | Yes – Using a [launch template](launch-templates.md) | Yes | No – You don't manage nodes\. | 
| Can deploy your own custom CNI to nodes | Yes – Using a [launch template](launch-templates.md) with a custom AMI | Yes | No – You don't manage nodes\. | 
| Must update node AMI yourself | [Yes ](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/update-managed-node-group.html)– If you deployed an Amazon EKS optimized AMI, then you're notified in the Amazon EKS console when updates are available and can perform the update with one click in the console\. If you deployed a custom AMI, then you're not notified in the Amazon EKS console when updates are available and must perform the update yourself\. | [Yes ](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/update-workers.html) \- Using tools other than the Amazon EKS console, because self\-managed nodes can't be managed with the Amazon EKS console\. |  No – You don't manage nodes\. | 
| Must update node Kubernetes version yourself | [Yes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/update-managed-node-group.html) – If you deployed an Amazon EKS optimized AMI, then you're notified in the Amazon EKS console when updates are available and can perform the update with one click in the console\. If you deployed a custom AMI, then you're not notified in the Amazon EKS console when updates are available and must perform the update yourself\. | [Yes ](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/update-workers.html) – Using tools other than the Amazon EKS console, because self\-managed nodes can't be managed with the Amazon EKS console\. | No – You don't manage nodes\. |
