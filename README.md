## Amazon EKS User Guide

Welcome to the Amazon EKS User Guide repository. This repository contains the open source version of the [Amazon EKS User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/).

## Important Update

This repository will be temporarily taken down to prepare for a new contributor experience. The repository will return at the same url by mid-November. 

## New Contribution Experience Coming Soon

We are temporarily taking down the current GitHub repository to prepare for an enhanced contribution experience. The new version will be available in mid-November with the following improvements:

- **AsciiDoc-Powered Documentation**: The guide will use AsciiDoc, an intuitive yet powerful authoring language similar to Markdown that offers:
  - Advanced formatting capabilities
  - Robust cross-referencing
  - Enhanced security controls
  - Enterprise-grade documentation features

- **Streamlined Contribution Process**:
  - Direct editing of documentation source files
  - Faster pull request processing
  - Increased automation
  - Reduced manual steps

## Stay Tuned

For more information about the new experience, see [Contribute](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/contribute.html) in the Amazon EKS User Guide.

We look forward to your contributions when we launch the new GitHub experience. The improved platform will make it easier than ever to help us enhance the Amazon EKS documentation.
