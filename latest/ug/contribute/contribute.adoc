{aws} is building an improved contribution experience for the EKS User Guide.

The previous GitHub repository at `awsdocs/amazon-eks-user-guide` is temporarily unavailable while we prepare the new contribution system.

The updated experience will use AsciiDoc, a powerful authoring language similar to markdown. AsciiDoc combines simple syntax with enterprise documentation features like advanced formatting, cross-referencing, and security controls.

When the EKS User Guide returns to GitHub in mid-November, you'll be able to edit the documentation source files directly. Our streamlined process includes:

* Faster pull request processing
* Reduced manual steps 
* Automated content quality checks

We look forward to your contributions.
