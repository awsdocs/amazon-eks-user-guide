When running workloads in an EKS cluster with {eam}, you might need to control whether specific workloads run on {eam} nodes or other compute types. This topic describes how to use node selectors and affinity rules to ensure your workloads are scheduled on the intended compute infrastructure.

The examples in this topic demonstrate how to use the `eks.amazonaws.com/compute-type` label to either require or prevent workload deployment on {eam} nodes. This is particularly useful in mixed-mode clusters where you're running both {eam} and other compute types, such as self-managed Karpenter provisioners or EKS Managed Node Groups.

{eam} nodes have set the value of the label `eks.amazonaws.com/compute-type` to `auto`. You can use this label to control if a workload is deployed to nodes managed by {eam}.

== Require a workload is deployed to {eam} nodes

[note]
====
This `nodeSelector` value is not required for {eam}. This `nodeSelector` value is only relevant if you are running a cluster in a mixed mode, node types not managed by {eam}. For example, you may have static compute capacity deployed to your cluster with EKS Managed Node Groups, and have dynamic compute capacity managed by {eam}.
====

You can add this `nodeSelector` to Deployments or other workloads to require Kubernetes schedule them onto {eam} nodes.

== Require a workload is not deployed to {eam} nodes

You can add this `nodeAffinity` to Deployments or other workloads to require Kubernetes *not* schedule them onto {eam} nodes.
