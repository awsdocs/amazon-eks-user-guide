Amazon EKS Node Classes provide granular control over the configuration of your {eam} managed nodes. A Node Class defines infrastructure-level settings that apply to groups of nodes in your EKS cluster, including network configuration, storage settings, and resource tagging. This topic explains how to create and configure a Node Class to meet your specific operational requirements.

When you need to customize how {eam} provisions and configures EC2 instances beyond the default settings, creating a Node Class gives you precise control over critical infrastructure parameters. For example, you can specify private subnet placement for enhanced security, configure instance ephemeral storage for performance-sensitive workloads, or apply custom tagging for cost allocation.

## Create a Node Class

To create a Node Class, follow these steps:

. Create a YAML file (for example, `nodeclass.yaml`) with your Node Class configuration
. Apply the configuration to your cluster using `kubectl`
. Reference the Node Class in your Node Pool configuration. For more information, see <<create-node-pool>>.

You need `kubectl` installed and configured. For more information, see <<setting-up>>.

### Basic Node Class Example

Here's an example Node Class:

//GDC: need to update this with IAM role and subnet selector

```yaml
apiVersion: eks.amazonaws.com/v1
kind: NodeClass
metadata:
  name: private-compute
spec:
  ephemeralStorage:
    size: "160Gi" 
```

This NodeClass increases the amount of ephemeral storage on the node. 

Apply this configuration using:

```bash
kubectl apply -f nodeclass.yaml
```

Next, reference the Node Class in your Node Pool configuration. For more information, see <<create-node-pool>>.

== Node Class Specification 

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: eks.amazonaws.com/v1
kind: NodeClass
metadata:
  name: default
spec:

  # Required: Name of IAM Role for Nodes
  role: "MyNodeRole"

  # Required: Subnet selection for node placement
  subnetSelectorTerms:
    - tags:
        Name: "<tag-name>"
        kubernetes.io/role/internal-elb: "1"
    # Alternative using direct subnet ID
    # - id: "subnet-0123456789abcdef0"
  
  # Required: Security group selection for nodes
  securityGroupSelectorTerms:
    - tags:

  # Optional: Configure SNAT policy (defaults to Random)
  snatPolicy: Random  # or Disabled
  
  # Optional: Network policy configuration (defaults to DefaultAllow)
  networkPolicy: DefaultAllow  # or DefaultDeny

  # Optional: Additional EC2 tags
  tags:
    Environment: "production"
    Team: "platform"

*Considerations:*

* If you change the Node IAM Role associated with a NodeClass, you will need to create a new Access Entry. EKS automatically creates an Access Entry for the Node IAM Role during cluster creation. The Node IAM Role requires the `AmazonEKSAutoNodePolicy` EKS Access Policy. For more information, see <<access-entries>>.
* EKS limits the maximum number of pods on a node to 110. This limit is applied after the existing max pods calculation. For more information, see <<choosing-instance-type>>. 
* If you want to propagate tags from Kubernetes to EC2, you need to configure additional IAM permissions. For more information, see <<auto-learn-iam>>.
