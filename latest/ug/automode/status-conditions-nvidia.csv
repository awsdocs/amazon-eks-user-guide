XID,Error Type,Error Description,Threshold for Repair,Repair Action
48,Double Bit ECC Error,These are double bit ECC errors reported by the driver.,Single occurrence,Replacement - Graceful termination of node
63,ECC page retirement or row remapping recording event,"Events are logged when there's a page retirement or row remap. If this happens, you should replace the node.",Single occurrence,Replacement - Graceful termination of node
64,ECC page retirement or row remapping recording failure,These events are logged when there's failures trying to retire a page or perform a node remap,Single occurrence,Replacement - Graceful termination of node
74,NVLink Error,"This event is logged when the GPU detects that a problem with a connection from the GPU to another GPU or NVSwitch over NVLink. 

This event may indicate a hardware failure with the link itself, or may indicate a problem with the device at the remote end of the link.",Single occurrence,Reboot Instance
79,GPU has fallen off the bus,"This event is logged when the GPU driver attempts to access the GPU over its PCI Express connection and finds that the GPU is not accessible.

(Similar to 74, except this is over PCIe)",Single occurrence,Reboot Instance
"94, 95","Contained ECC error occurred (A100, H100)
Uncontained ECC error occurred (A100, H100)","These events are logged when GPU drivers handle ECC memory errors in GPUs that support ECC Error containment, starting with p4s. 


Since Nvidia attempts to address these errors through dynamic page offlining on 100-class GPUs, we don't need to trigger a repair action directly.",Depends on the client flags we're able to get from SMBPBI,"1. If GPU architecture earlier than A100, we will reboot the instance.

2. Do nothing, if reset pending or row remapping pending flag is set. 

3. If MIG is configured or the row remapping failure bit is set, we will  reboot the instance."
119,GSP RPC Timeout,These are errors reported when the GSP times out responding to RPC requests from other bits in the driver,TBD - Need to determine how many such failures should trigger a node replacement since these can be common.,Replacement - Graceful termination of node
120,GSP Error,"Similar to 119, these are scenarios where GSP has responded in time, but with an error.",Similar to 119.,Replacement - Graceful termination of node
121,C2C Link corrected error,"C2C is chip interconnect - it enables sharing memory between CPUs and accelerators etc. As per Nvidia docs, these errors don't represent operational impact.",Single occurrence,Informational only
140,ECC unrecovered error,"This event may occur when the GPU driver has observed uncorrectable errors in GPU memory, in such a way as to interrupt the GPU driverâ€™s ability to mark the pages for dynamic page offlining or row remapping",Single occurrence,Replacement - Forceful termination of node
