IAM Role::
An IAM identity that you can create in your {aws} account that has specific permissions. You can use IAM roles to delegate access to users, applications, or services that don't normally have access to your {aws} resources.

* You can attach {aws} IAM Policies to the role.
* You can also use EKS access entries to attach Kubernetes RBAC permissions to the role. 

Kubernetes Role::
A Kubernetes resource that defines a set of permission rules within a namespace. Roles specify which operations (verbs) are allowed on which resources in the Kubernetes API.

{aws} Managed IAM Policy::
A standalone policy that is created and administered by {aws}. {aws} managed policies are designed to provide permissions for many common use cases and are maintained by {aws}.

EKS Access Policy::
A set of Kubernetes permissions that are managed by Amazon EKS. You can associate an EKS access policy with an IAM role to control access to your Amazon EKS cluster.

EKS Access Entry::
The connection between an EKS access policy and an IAM role. An access entry gives an IAM role specific permissions on your Amazon EKS cluster.

EKS Managed Node Group::
//Find something from Alex?

Fargate Pod::
A pod that runs on {aws} Fargate. Each pod runs in its own isolated compute environment, and components such as the kernel, CPU resources, and memory resources are not shared with other pods.

Self managed nodes::
Amazon EC2 instances that you manage as part of your Amazon EKS cluster. You are responsible for security patches, system updates, and all maintenance tasks.

Node Group::
A collection of Amazon EC2 instances that are configured to work with Amazon EKS. Node groups contain instances with the same configuration.

Node Class::
A template that defines the compute infrastructure for your nodes. Node classes specify settings such as instance types, storage configuration, and networking options.

Node Pool::
A Kubernetes custom resource that connects your workloads to a node class. Node pools determine which pods run on which types of nodes.

EKS Node Class for EKS Auto Mode::
A node class that is optimized for Amazon EKS. This class uses Amazon EKS-optimized AMIs and integrates with {aws} services for security, monitoring, and maintenance.

EC2 Node Class for Karpenter::
A node class that works with Karpenter, an open-source node provisioning project. This class provides direct control over Amazon EC2 instance configuration without using managed node groups.

Amazon EKS Auto Mode Managed Node::
An Amazon EC2 instance that is configured and managed by Amazon EKS Auto Mode. These nodes receive automatic updates and are optimized for running Kubernetes workloads.

EKS Auto Mode Managed Node Pools::
The default node pools that are included with every Amazon EKS Auto Mode cluster. These pools are preconfigured for different workload types.

EKS Auto Mode Managed Node Pool -- General Purpose::
A default node pool that is suitable for most workloads. This pool provides balanced compute and memory resources.

EKS Auto Mode Managed Node Pool -- System::
A default node pool that is optimized for running system workloads and cluster components.

EKS Auto Mode Managed EC2 Instance::
An Amazon EC2 instance that is managed as part of Amazon EKS Auto Mode. {aws} maintains these instances and automatically applies security patches and updates.

EKS Auto Mode -- Compute Capability::
A feature that automatically manages compute resources in Amazon EKS Auto Mode clusters. This capability handles tasks such as scaling nodes and selecting instance types based on workload requirements.

EKS Auto Mode -- Block Storage Capability::
A feature that manages Amazon EBS volumes in Amazon EKS Auto Mode clusters. This capability automatically handles volume provisioning and lifecycle management for pods that need persistent storage.

EKS Auto Mode -- Load Balancing Capability::
A feature that manages Application Load Balancers and Network Load Balancers in Amazon EKS Auto Mode clusters. This capability automatically configures load balancers based on your service requirements.
