# Configure an AsciiDoc Authoring Environment on Windows using Visual Studio Code

## Prereqs

* Visual Studio Code installed from Microsoft Website
* Connected to Amazon VPN
* Know your Cloud Dev Desktop Hostname, such as `http://dev-dsk-mcngs-2a-f991a827.us-west-2.amazon.com/`
* Amazon Windows Image

## Step 1: Clear SSH Keys

[IMPORTANT]
====
Do not complete this step if you use SSH to access remote devices not managed by Amazon Corporate.
====

. Open PowerShell:
** Press Windows key + X
** Select "Windows PowerShell (Admin)" or "Windows Terminal (Admin)"
** If prompted by User Account Control, click "Yes"

. Backup existing SSH keys:
** Navigate to your SSH directory by typing: `cd ~\.ssh`
** Create a backup folder: `mkdir ~\ssh_backup`
** Copy all files to the backup location: `Copy-Item -Path ~\.ssh\* -Destination ~\ssh_backup -Recurse`
** Verify the backup by checking the contents: `dir ~\ssh_backup`

. Remove existing SSH keys:
** Make sure you're in the SSH directory: `cd ~\.ssh`
** Delete all files in the .ssh folder: `Remove-Item -Path ~\.ssh\* -Recurse -Force`
** Verify the directory is empty: `dir`
** If the .ssh directory itself is causing issues, you can remove it entirely: `Remove-Item ~\.ssh -Recurse -Force`

[NOTE]
====
If you need to restore your keys later, you can copy them back from the backup folder using:
`Copy-Item -Path ~\ssh_backup\* -Destination ~\.ssh -Recurse`
====

## Step 2: Create new ECDSA SSH Key

. `ssh-keygen -t ecdsa`

## Step 3: Use Midway to Sign SSH Key

. `mwinit` -- WITHOUT options
. You will need to run this step periodically from windows powershell. 
** You need to run mwinit from each device, including your laptop and CDD. 

## Step 4: Test SSH 

. Run `ssh <alias>@git.amazon.com -v `
. Review output
. If you don't see a success message, sent the output to Geoffrey

## Step 5: Configure VS Code

. Open VS Code
. Open the extension panel in the left sidebar (tetris style icon)
. Search for "SSH" remote extension and install
. Open the remote panel in the left sidebar (computer monitor icon with circular icon in bottom right)
. Mouse over `SSH` and then press the plus icon
. Insert the following value: `ssh <alias>@<cdd-hostname>`
. Press enter and follow the prompts
. If the VS Code Window shows your CDD hostname in blue in the botton left of the window, that VS Code Window is connected to your CDD
. Once it is connect, use `ctrl-`` to open a terminal window. 

## Step 6: Clone Package on Cloud Dev Desktop

[source,bash]
----
brazil ws create --name eks
cd eks
brazil ws use -vs AWSDevDocsAlpha/alpha
brazil ws use AmazonEKSDocs
cd src/AmazonEKSDocs
pwd
----

In the AmazonEKSDocs package root is a file called `eks-docs.code-workspace`, use the output of `pwd` and this file name to determine the full path to the code workspace.

## Step 7: Open Code Workspace

From a SSH connected VS Code Window, go to "file" and then "open workspace from file". Use the path to the code workspace file.

Using this file, VS code will automatically configure itself for authoring asciidoc. 

## To reconnect

. Connect to VPN
. Use powershell to run mwinit
. Open VS Code
. Select the `eks-docs` workspace from recently opened workspaces, verify the hostname of your CDD is shown by the workspace name on the home screen
. Alternatively, open the Remote Explorer panel in the left sidebar
. Find your CDD and the eks-docs workspace under it, mouse over it
. Use the right arrow icon to open the workspace in the curent window, or the plus icon to open in a new window
