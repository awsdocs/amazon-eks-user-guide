= Create a VPC for Amazon EKS with the web console
:info_doctype: section

This guide walks you through creating a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) that's optimized for Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) clusters using the {aws} Management Console.

== Overview

When creating a VPC for EKS, you'll need to configure specific networking requirements to ensure proper cluster functionality, including:
- Public and private subnets across multiple Availability Zones
- NAT gateways for outbound internet access from private subnets
- Appropriate CIDR ranges to accommodate pod and service IP addresses
- Required VPC endpoints for EKS functionality

== Prerequisites

- An {aws} account
- Access to the {aws} Management Console
- IAM permissions for VPC and EKS resource creation
- Planned CIDR ranges for your VPC, pods, and services

== Creation Steps

=== Step 1: Access the VPC Creation Page
1. Sign in to the {aws} Management Console
2. Navigate to the VPC Dashboard
3. Click "Create VPC"

=== Step 2: Configure Basic VPC Settings
1. Under "VPC settings", select "VPC and more"
2. Enter a name tag in the "Name tag auto-generation" field
   - Example: "eks-cluster-vpc"
   - This will auto-generate names for all resources with the prefix

=== Step 3: Configure Network Settings
1. IPv4 CIDR block:
   - Enter your VPC CIDR (recommended: 10.0.0.0/16)
   - Ensure the CIDR is large enough to accommodate:
     - EKS nodes
     - Pods (default CNI: up to 250 pods per node)
     - Services (default: 10.100.0.0/16)

2. Set Availability Zones:
   - Select at least two AZs (recommended: 3 for production)
   - EKS requires a minimum of two AZs for high availability

3. Configure Subnets:
   - Public subnets: Set to 2 or 3 (matching your AZ count)
     - Required for public-facing load balancers
     - Used for NAT gateways
   - Private subnets: Set to 2 or 3 (matching your AZ count)
     - Will host your EKS nodes
     - Must have outbound internet access via NAT

=== Step 4: Configure NAT Gateways
1. Choose "1 per AZ" for production environments
   - While more expensive, this provides high availability for node outbound traffic
   - For dev/test, you can use "In 1 AZ" to reduce costs

=== Step 5: Configure VPC Endpoints
1. Select "S3 Gateway"
   - Required for pulling container images from Amazon ECR
2. Consider adding these endpoints later for enhanced security:
   - com.amazonaws.[region].ecr.api
   - com.amazonaws.[region].ecr.dkr
   - com.amazonaws.[region].eks
   - com.amazonaws.[region].elasticloadbalancing
   - com.amazonaws.[region].logs

=== Step 6: Configure DNS Options
1. Enable both options:
   - DNS hostnames (required for EKS)
   - DNS resolution (required for EKS)

=== Step 7: Review and Create
1. Review the preview panel to ensure:
   - All subnets are properly distributed across AZs
   - CIDR ranges don't overlap
2. Click "Create VPC"

== Post-Creation Configuration

=== Step 1: Tag Subnets for EKS
After VPC creation, add these required tags to your subnets:

For public subnets:
```
kubernetes.io/cluster/<cluster-name> = shared
kubernetes.io/role/elb = 1
```

For private subnets:
```
kubernetes.io/cluster/<cluster-name> = shared
kubernetes.io/role/internal-elb = 1
```

=== Step 2: Security Group Configuration
1. Create a cluster security group that allows:
   - All inbound traffic from within the VPC
   - Required outbound traffic for node communication

== Best Practices

1. Networking:
   - Use private subnets for worker nodes
   - Use public subnets only for load balancers
   - Ensure sufficient IP addresses for pods and services

2. High Availability:
   - Use 3 AZs for production environments
   - Deploy NAT Gateways in each AZ
   - Size subnets appropriately for expected growth

3. Security:
   - Implement VPC endpoints for {aws} services
   - Use security groups to control traffic
   - Follow the principle of least privilege

== Next Steps

1. Create your EKS cluster using this VPC
2. Configure additional VPC endpoints as needed
3. Set up monitoring for NAT gateway bandwidth
4. Plan IP address management for pods and services

== Troubleshooting Tips

1. Common Issues:
   - Insufficient IP addresses for pods
   - Missing required subnet tags
   - NAT gateway connectivity issues

2. Validation Steps:
   - Verify subnet tags
   - Check route tables
   - Confirm security group rules
