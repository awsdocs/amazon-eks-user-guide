|Pricing
|Cost of Amazon EC2 instance that runs multiple Pods. For more information, see Amazon EC2 pricing.
| When EKS Auto Mode is enabled in your cluster, you pay a separate fee, in addition to the standard EC2 instance charges, for the instances launched using Auto Mode's compute capability. The amount varies with the instance type launched and the {aws} region where your cluster is located. For more information, see link:eks/pricing/["Amazon EKS pricing",type="marketing"].
