Amazon EKS platform versions represent the capabilities of the Amazon EKS cluster control plane, such as which [.noloc]`Kubernetes` API server flags are enabled, as well as the current [.noloc]`Kubernetes` patch version. Each [.noloc]`Kubernetes` minor version has one or more associated Amazon EKS platform versions. The platform versions for different [.noloc]`Kubernetes` minor versions are independent. You can  <<get-platform-version,retrieve your cluster's current platform version>> using the {aws} CLI or {aws-management-console}. If you have a local cluster on {aws} Outposts, see <<eks-outposts-platform-versions>> instead of this topic.

When a new [.noloc]`Kubernetes` minor version is available in Amazon EKS, such as 1.30, the initial Amazon EKS platform version for that [.noloc]`Kubernetes` minor version starts at `eks.1`. However, Amazon EKS releases new platform versions periodically to enable new [.noloc]`Kubernetes` control plane settings and to provide security fixes.

When new Amazon EKS platform versions become available for a minor version:



* The Amazon EKS platform version number is incremented (`eks.<n+1>`).
* Amazon EKS automatically upgrades all existing clusters to the latest Amazon EKS platform version for their corresponding [.noloc]`Kubernetes` minor version. Automatic upgrades of existing Amazon EKS platform versions are rolled out incrementally. The roll-out process might take some time. If you need the latest Amazon EKS platform version features immediately, you should create a new Amazon EKS cluster.
+
If your cluster is more than two platform versions behind the current platform version, then it's possible that Amazon EKS wasn't able to automatically update your cluster. For details of what may cause this, see <<troubleshooting-platform-version>>.
* Amazon EKS might publish a new node AMI with a corresponding patch version. However, all patch versions are compatible between the EKS control plane and node AMIs for a given [.noloc]`Kubernetes` minor version.

New Amazon EKS platform versions don't introduce breaking changes or cause service interruptions.

Clusters are always created with the latest available Amazon EKS platform version (`eks.<n>`) for the specified [.noloc]`Kubernetes` version. If you update your cluster to a new [.noloc]`Kubernetes` minor version, your cluster receives the current Amazon EKS platform version for the [.noloc]`Kubernetes` minor version that you updated to.

The current and recent Amazon EKS platform versions are described in the following tables.

[NOTE]
====

{aws} recently disabled some platform versions published in June 2024. The platform versions had stability issues. No action is needed.

== Change platform version

You cannot change the platform version of an EKS cluster. When new Amazon EKS platform versions become available for a [.noloc]`Kubernetes` version, EKS automatically upgrades all existing clusters to the latest Amazon EKS platform version for their corresponding [.noloc]`Kubernetes` version. Automatic upgrades of existing Amazon EKS platform versions are rolled out incrementally. You cannot use the {aws} Console or CLI to change the platform version.  

If you upgrade your [.noloc]`Kubernetes` version, your cluster will move onto the most recent platform version for the [.noloc]`Kubernetes` version.
