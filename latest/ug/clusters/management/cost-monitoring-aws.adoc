.Cost monitoring using {aws} split cost allocation data for Amazon EKS
You can use {aws} split cost allocation data for Amazon EKS to get granular cost visibility for your Amazon EKS clusters. This enables you to analyze, optimize, and chargeback cost and usage for your [.noloc]`Kubernetes` applications. You allocate application costs to individual business units and teams based on Amazon EC2 CPU and memory resources consumed by your [.noloc]`Kubernetes` application. Split cost allocation data for Amazon EKS gives visibility into cost per Pod, and enables you to aggregate the cost data per Pod using namespace, cluster, and other [.noloc]`Kubernetes` primitives. The following are examples of [.noloc]`Kubernetes` primitives that you can use to analyze Amazon EKS cost allocation data.  

* Cluster name 
* Deployment 
* Namespace 
* Node 
* Workload Name 
* Workload Type 

For more information about using split cost allocation data, see link:cur/latest/userguide/split-cost-allocation-data.html[Understanding split cost allocation data,type="documentation"] in the {aws} Billing User Guide.
