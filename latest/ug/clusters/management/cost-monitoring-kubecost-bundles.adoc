Amazon EKS provides an {aws} optimized bundle of [.noloc]`Kubecost` for cluster cost visibility. Amazon EKS supports [.noloc]`Kubecost`, which you can use to monitor your costs broken down by [.noloc]`Kubernetes` resources including [.noloc]`Pods`, nodes, namespaces, and labels.

This topic covers the available versions of [.noloc]`Kubecost`, and the differences between the available tiers. EKS supports [.noloc]`Kubecost` Version 1 and Version 2. Each version is available in different tiers. You can use  _Amazon EKS optimized [.noloc]`Kubecost` custom bundle_ for your EKS clusters at no additional cost. You may be charged for use of associated {aws} services, such as Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus. Also, you can use your existing {aws} support agreements to obtain support. 

As a [.noloc]`Kubernetes` platform administrator and finance leader, you can use [.noloc]`Kubecost` to visualize a breakdown of Amazon EKS charges, allocate costs, and charge back organizational units such as application teams. You can provide your internal teams and business units with transparent and accurate cost data based on their actual {aws} bill. Moreover, you can also get customized recommendations for cost optimization based on their infrastructure environment and usage patterns within their clusters. For more information about [.noloc]`Kubecost`, see the https://guide.kubecost.com[Kubecost] documentation.

*What is the difference between the custom bundle of [.noloc]`Kubecost` and the free version of [.noloc]`Kubecost` (also known as [.noloc]`OpenCost`)?*

{aws} and [.noloc]`Kubecost` collaborated to offer a customized version of [.noloc]`Kubecost`. This version includes a subset of commercial features at no additional charge. See the tables below for features that are included with in the custom bundle of [.noloc]`Kubecost`.

[[cost-monitoring-faq,cost-monitoring-faq.title]]
== Frequently asked questions

See the following common questions and answers about using [.noloc]`Kubecost` with Amazon EKS.

*What is the Kubecost API retention (ETL) feature?*

The Kubecost ETL feature aggregates and organizes metrics to surface cost visibility at various levels of granularity (such as `namespace-level`, `pod-level`, and `deployment-level`). For the custom Kubecost bundle, customers get data and insights from metrics for the last 15 days.

*What is the alerts and recurring reports feature? What alerts and reports does it include?*

Kubecost alerts allow teams to receive updates on real-time Kubernetes spend as well as cloud spend. Recurring reports enable teams to receive customized views of historical Kubernetes and cloud spend. Both are configurable using the Kubecost UI or Helm values. They support email, Slack, and Microsoft Teams.

*What do saved reports include?*

Kubecost saved reports are predefined views of cost and efficiency metrics. They include cost by cluster, namespace, label, and more.

*What is cloud billing integration?*

Integration with {aws} billing APIs allows Kubecost to display out-of-cluster costs (such as Amazon S3). Additionally, it allows Kubecost to reconcile Kubecost`'s in-cluster predictions with actual billing data to account for spot usage, savings plans, and enterprise discounts.

*What do savings recommendations include?*

Kubecost provides insights and automation to help users optimize their Kubernetes infrastructure and spend.

*Is there a charge for this functionality?*

No. You can use this version of Kubecost at no additional charge. If you want additional Kubecost capabilities that aren`'t included in this bundle, you can buy an enterprise license of Kubecost through the {aws} Marketplace, or from Kubecost directly.

*Is support available?*

Yes. You can open a support case with the {aws} Support team at link:contact-us/[Contact {aws},type="marketing"].

*Do I need a license to use Kubecost features provided by the Amazon EKS integration?*

No.

*Can I integrate Kubecost with {aws} Cost and Usage Report for more accurate reporting?*

Yes. You can configure Kubecost to ingest data from {aws} Cost and Usage Report to get accurate cost visibility, including discounts, Spot pricing, reserved instance pricing, and others. For more information, see https://docs.kubecost.com/install-and-configure/install/cloud-integration/aws-cloud-integrations[{aws} Cloud Billing Integration] in the Kubecost documentation.

*Does this version support cost management of self-managed Kubernetes clusters on Amazon EC2?*

No. This version is only compatible with Amazon EKS clusters.

*Can Kubecost track costs for Amazon EKS on {aws} Fargate?*

Kubecost provides best effort to show cluster cost visibility for Amazon EKS on Fargate, but with lower accuracy than with Amazon EKS on Amazon EC2. This is primarily due to the difference in how you`'re billed for your usage. With Amazon EKS on Fargate, you`'re billed for consumed resources. With Amazon EKS on Amazon EC2 nodes, you`'re billed for provisioned resources. Kubecost calculates the cost of an Amazon EC2 node based on the node specification, which includes CPU, RAM, and ephemeral storage. With Fargate, costs are calculated based on the requested resources for the Fargate Pods.

*How can I get updates and new versions of Kubecost?*

You can upgrade your Kubecost version using standard Helm upgrade procedures. The latest versions are in the https://gallery.ecr.aws/kubecost/cost-analyzer[Amazon ECR Public Gallery].

*Is the `*kubectl-cost*` CLI supported? How do I install it?*

Yes. `Kubectl-cost` is an open source tool by Kubecost (Apache 2.0 License) that provides CLI access to Kubernetes cost allocation metrics. To install `kubectl-cost`, see https://github.com/kubecost/kubectl-cost#installation[Installation] on GitHub.

*Is the Kubecost user interface supported? How do I access it?*

Kubecost provides a web dashboard that you can access through `kubectl` port forwarding, an ingress, or a load balancer. You can also use the {aws} Load Balancer Controller to expose Kubecost and use Amazon Cognito for authentication, authorization, and user management. For more information, see link:containers/how-to-use-application-load-balancer-and-amazon-cognito-to-authenticate-users-for-your-kubernetes-web-apps[How to use Application Load Balancer and Amazon Cognito to authenticate users for your Kubernetes web apps,type="blog"] on the {aws} blog.

*Is Amazon EKS Anywhere supported?*

No.

[[kubecost-additional,kubecost-additional.title]]
== Additional [.noloc]`Kubecost` Features

* The following features are available in both [.noloc]`Kubecost` v1 and v2.  
* *Export cost metrics* – Amazon EKS optimized cost monitoring is deployed with [.noloc]`Kubecost` and [.noloc]`Prometheus`, which is an open-source monitoring system and time series database. [.noloc]`Kubecost` reads metric from [.noloc]`Prometheus` and then performs cost allocation calculations and writes the metrics back to [.noloc]`Prometheus`. The [.noloc]`Kubecost` front-end reads metrics from [.noloc]`Prometheus` and shows them on the [.noloc]`Kubecost` user interface. The architecture is illustrated in the following diagram.
+
image::images/kubecost-architecture.png[Kubecost architecture,scaledwidth=100%]
+
With https://prometheus.io/[Prometheus] pre-installed, you can write queries to ingest [.noloc]`Kubecost` data into your current business intelligence system for further analysis. You can also use it as a data source for your current https://grafana.com/[Grafana] dashboard to display Amazon EKS cluster costs that your internal teams are familiar with. To learn more about how to write [.noloc]`Prometheus` queries, see the https://github.com/opencost/opencost/blob/develop/PROMETHEUS.md[Prometheus Configuration]``readme`` file on GitHub or use the example [.noloc]`Grafana` JSON models in the https://github.com/kubecost/cost-analyzer-helm-chart/tree/develop/cost-analyzer[Kubecost Github repository] as references.
* *{aws} Cost and Usage Report integration* – To perform cost allocation calculations for your Amazon EKS cluster, [.noloc]`Kubecost` retrieves the public pricing information of {aws} services and {aws} resources from the {aws} Price List API. You can also integrate [.noloc]`Kubecost` with  *{aws} Cost and Usage Report*::
 to enhance the accuracy of the pricing information specific to your {aws} account. This information includes enterprise discount programs, reserved instance usage, savings plans, and spot usage. To learn more about how the {aws} Cost and Usage Report integration works, see https://docs.kubecost.com/install-and-configure/install/cloud-integration/aws-cloud-integrations[{aws} Cloud Billing Integration] in the [.noloc]`Kubecost` documentation.
