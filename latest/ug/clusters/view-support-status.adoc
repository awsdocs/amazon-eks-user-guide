= View current cluster support period
:info_titleabbrev: View support period

The  *cluster support period* section of the {aws} console indicates if your cluster is  _currently_ on standard or extended support. If your cluster support period is *Extended support*, you are being charged for EKS extended support.  

For more information about standard and extended support, see <<kubernetes-versions>>.

. Navigate to the *Clusters* page in the EKS section of the {aws} Console. Confirm the console is set to the same {aws} region as the cluster you want to review.  
. Review the *Support Period* column. If the value is  *Standard support until...*, you are not currently being charged for extended support. You are within the standard support period. If the value is  *Extended support...* this cluster is currently being charged for extended support.  


[NOTE]
====

The  *Support Period* cannot be retrieved with the {aws} API or CLI.
