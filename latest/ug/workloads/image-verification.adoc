If you use link:signer/latest/developerguide/Welcome.html[{aws} Signer,type="documentation"] and want to verify signed container images at the time of deployment, you can use one of the following solutions:



* https://ratify.dev/docs/1.0/quickstarts/ratify-on-aws[Gatekeeper and Ratify] – Use Gatekeeper as the admission controller and Ratify configured with an {aws} Signer plugin as a web hook for validating signatures.
* https://github.com/nirmata/kyverno-notation-aws[Kyverno] – A [.noloc]`Kubernetes` policy engine configured with an {aws} Signer plugin for validating signatures.


[NOTE]
====

Before verifying container image signatures, configure the https://github.com/notaryproject/notation#readme[Notation] trust store and trust policy, as required by your selected admission controller.
