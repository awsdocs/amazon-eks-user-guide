= Determine fields you can customize for Amazon EKS add-ons
:info_doctype: section

[abstract]
--
Learn how to manage Amazon EKS add-on configurations using Kubernetes field management to customize settings without overwriting Amazon EKS managed fields.
--

Amazon EKS add-ons are installed to your cluster using standard, best practice configurations. For more information about adding an Amazon EKS add-on to your cluster, see <<eks-add-ons>>. 

You may want to customize the configuration of an Amazon EKS add-on to enable advanced features. Amazon EKS uses the [.noloc]`Kubernetes` server-side apply feature to enable management of an add-on by Amazon EKS without overwriting your configuration for settings that aren't managed by Amazon EKS. For more information, see https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/server-side-apply/[Server-Side Apply] in the [.noloc]`Kubernetes` documentation. To achieve this, Amazon EKS manages a minimum set of fields for every add-on that it installs. You can modify all fields that aren't managed by Amazon EKS, or another [.noloc]`Kubernetes` control plane process such as `kube-controller-manager`, without issue. 

[IMPORTANT]
====

Modifying a field managed by Amazon EKS prevents Amazon EKS from managing the add-on and may result in your changes being overwritten when an add-on is updated.

== Field management syntax

When you view details for a [.noloc]`Kubernetes` object, both managed and unmanaged fields are returned in the output. Managed fields can be either of the following types:



* *Fully managed*
 ‚Äì All keys for the field are managed by Amazon EKS. Modifications to any value causes a conflict.
* *Partially managed*
 ‚Äì Some keys for the field are managed by Amazon EKS. Only modifications to the keys explicitly managed by Amazon EKS cause a conflict.

Both types of fields are tagged with `manager: eks`.

Each key is either a `.` representing the field itself, which always maps to an empty set, or a string that represents a sub-field or item. The output for field management consists of the following types of declarations:



* `f:[.replaceable]``name```, where [.replaceable]`name` is the name of a field in a list.
* `k:[.replaceable]``keys```, where [.replaceable]`keys` is a map of a list item's fields.
* `v:[.replaceable]``value```, where [.replaceable]`value` is the exact JSON formatted value of a list item.
* `i:[.replaceable]``index```, where [.replaceable]`index` is position of an item in the list.

The following portions of output for the [.noloc]`CoreDNS` add-on illustrate the previous declarations:  



* *Fully managed fields*
 ‚Äì If a managed field has an `f:` (field) specified, but no `k:` (key), then the entire field is managed. Modifications to any values in this field cause a conflict. 
+
In the following output, you can see that the container named `coredns` is managed by `eks`. The `args`, `image`, and `imagePullPolicy` sub-fields are also managed by `eks`. Modifications to any values in these fields cause a conflict.
+
[source]
----
[...]
f:containers:
  k:{"name":"coredns"}:
  .: {}
  f:args: {}
  f:image: {}
  f:imagePullPolicy: {}
[...]
manager: eks
[...]
----
* *Partially managed fields*
 ‚Äì If a managed key has a value specified, the declared keys are managed for that field. Modifying the specified keys cause a conflict.  
+
In the following output, you can see that `eks` manages the `config-volume` and `tmp` volumes set with the `name` key.
+
[source]
----
[...]
f:volumes:
  k:{"name":"config-volume"}:
    .: {}
    f:configMap:
      f:items: {}
      f:name: {}
    f:name: {}
  k:{"name":"tmp"}:
    .: {}
    f:name: {}
[...]
manager: eks
[...]
----
* *Adding keys to partially managed fields*
 ‚Äì If only a specific key value is managed, you can safely add additional keys, such as arguments, to a field without causing a conflict. If you add additional keys, make sure that the field isn't managed first. Adding or modifying any value that is managed causes a conflict.
+
In the following output, you can see that both the `name` key and `name` field are managed. Adding or modifying any container name causes a conflict with this managed key. 
+
[source,yaml,subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
[...]
f:containers:
  k:{"name":"coredns"}:
[...]
    f:name: {}
[...]
manager: eks
[...]

== Procedure

You can use `kubectl` to see which fields are managed by Amazon EKS for any Amazon EKS add-on. 

You can modify all fields that aren't managed by Amazon EKS, or another [.noloc]`Kubernetes` control plane process such as `kube-controller-manager`, without issue. 

. Determine which add-on that you want to examine. To see all of the `deployments` and [.noloc]`DaemonSets` deployed to your cluster, see <<view-kubernetes-resources>>.
. View the managed fields for an add-on by running the following command:
+
[source,bash,subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
kubectl get type/add-on-name -n add-on-namespace -o yaml
----
+
For example, you can see the managed fields for the [.noloc]`CoreDNS` add-on with the following command.
+
[source,bash,subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
kubectl get deployment/coredns -n kube-system -o yaml
----
+
Field management is listed in the following section in the returned output.
+
[source,yaml,subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
[...]
managedFields:
  - apiVersion: apps/v1
    fieldsType: FieldsV1
    fieldsV1:                        
[...]
----
+
NOTE: If you don't see `managedFields` in the output, add `--show-managed-fields` to the command and run it again. The version of `kubectl` that you're using determines whether managed fields are returned by default.
