:info_titleabbrev: Workloads

Your workloads are deployed in containers, which are deployed in [.noloc]`Pods` in [.noloc]`Kubernetes`. A [.noloc]`Pod` includes one or more containers. Typically, one or more [.noloc]`Pods` that provide the same service are deployed in a [.noloc]`Kubernetes` service. Once you've deployed multiple [.noloc]`Pods` that provide the same service, you can:



* <<view-kubernetes-resources,View information about the workloads>> running on each of your clusters using the {aws-management-console}.
* Vertically scale [.noloc]`Pods` up or down with the [.noloc]`Kubernetes` <<vertical-pod-autoscaler,Vertical Pod Autoscaler>>.
* Horizontally scale the number of [.noloc]`Pods` needed to meet demand up or down with the [.noloc]`Kubernetes` <<horizontal-pod-autoscaler,Horizontal Pod Autoscaler>>.
* Create an external (for internet-accessible [.noloc]`Pods`) or an internal (for private [.noloc]`Pods`)  <<network-load-balancing,network load balancer>> to balance network traffic across [.noloc]`Pods`. The load balancer routes traffic at Layer 4 of the OSI model.
* Create an <<alb-ingress,Application Load Balancer>> to balance application traffic across [.noloc]`Pods`. The application load balancer routes traffic at Layer 7 of the OSI model.
* If you're new to [.noloc]`Kubernetes`, this topic helps you  <<sample-deployment,Deploy a sample application>>.
* You can <<restrict-service-external-ip,restrict IP addresses that can be assigned to a service>> with `externalIPs`.
