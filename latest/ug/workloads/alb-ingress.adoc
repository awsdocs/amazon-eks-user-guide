Learn how to use Application Load Balancing on Amazon EKS to load balance application traffic at L7 with {aws} Load Balancer Controller.

[NOTE]
====
*New:* Amazon EKS Auto Mode automates routine tasks for load balancing. For more information, see:

* <<auto-elb-example>>
* <<auto-configure-alb>>

====

When you create a [.noloc]`Kubernetes` `ingress`, an {aws} Application Load Balancer (ALB) is provisioned that load balances application traffic. To learn more, see link:elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/introduction.html[What is an Application Load Balancer?,type="documentation"] in the _Application Load Balancers User Guide_ and https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/[Ingress] in the [.noloc]`Kubernetes` documentation. ALBs can be used with [.noloc]`Pods` that are deployed to nodes or to {aws} Fargate. You can deploy an ALB to public or private subnets.

Application traffic is balanced at `L7` of the OSI model. To load balance network traffic at `L4`, you deploy a [.noloc]`Kubernetes` `service` of the `LoadBalancer` type. This type provisions an {aws} Network Load Balancer. For more information, see <<network-load-balancing>>. To learn more about the differences between the two types of load balancing, see link:elasticloadbalancing/features/[Elastic Load Balancing features,type="marketing"] on the {aws} website. 


== Prerequisites

Before you can load balance application traffic to an application, you must meet the following requirements.

* Have an existing cluster. If you don't have an existing cluster, see <<getting-started>>. If you need to update the version of an existing cluster, see <<update-cluster>>.
* Have the [.noloc]`{aws} Load Balancer Controller` deployed on your cluster. For more information, see <<aws-load-balancer-controller>>. We recommend version `2.7.2` or later.
* At least two subnets in different Availability Zones. The [.noloc]`{aws} Load Balancer Controller` chooses one subnet from each Availability Zone. When multiple tagged subnets are found in an Availability Zone, the controller chooses the subnet whose subnet ID comes first lexicographically. Each subnet must have at least eight available IP addresses.
+
If you're using multiple security groups attached to worker node, exactly one security group must be tagged as follows. Replace [.replaceable]`my-cluster` with your cluster name.
+
** *Key*
 – `kubernetes.io/cluster/<my-cluster>`
** *Value*
 – `shared` or `owned`
* If you're using the [.noloc]`{aws} Load Balancer Controller` version `2.1.1` or earlier, subnets must be tagged in the format that follows. If you're using version `2.1.2` or later, tagging is optional. However, we recommend that you tag a subnet if any of the following is the case. You have multiple clusters that are running in the same VPC, or have multiple {aws} services that share subnets in a VPC. Or, you want more control over where load balancers are provisioned for each cluster. Replace [.replaceable]`my-cluster` with your cluster name.
+
** *Key*
 – `kubernetes.io/cluster/<my-cluster>`
** *Value*
 – `shared` or `owned`
* Your public and private subnets must meet the following requirements. This is unless you explicitly specify subnet IDs as an annotation on a service or ingress object. Assume that you provision load balancers by explicitly specifying subnet IDs as an annotation on a service or ingress object. In this situation, [.noloc]`Kubernetes` and the {aws} load balancer controller use those subnets directly to create the load balancer and the following tags aren't required.
+
** *Private subnets*
 – Must be tagged in the following format. This is so that [.noloc]`Kubernetes` and the {aws} load balancer controller know that the subnets can be used for internal load balancers. If you use `eksctl` or an Amazon EKS {aws} CloudFormation template to create your VPC after March 26, 2020, the subnets are tagged appropriately when created. For more information about the Amazon EKS {aws} CloudFormation VPC templates, see <<creating-a-vpc>>.
+
*** *Key*
 – `kubernetes.io/role/internal-elb`
*** *Value*
 – `1`
** *Public subnets*
 – Must be tagged in the following format. This is so that [.noloc]`Kubernetes` knows to use only the subnets that were specified for external load balancers. This way, [.noloc]`Kubernetes` doesn't choose a public subnet in each Availability Zone (lexicographically based on their subnet ID). If you use `eksctl` or an Amazon EKS {aws} CloudFormation template to create your VPC after March 26, 2020, the subnets are tagged appropriately when created. For more information about the Amazon EKS {aws} CloudFormation VPC templates, see <<creating-a-vpc>>.
+
*** *Key*
 – `kubernetes.io/role/elb`
*** *Value*
 – `1`

+
If the subnet role tags aren't explicitly added, the [.noloc]`Kubernetes` service controller examines the route table of your cluster VPC subnets. This is to determine if the subnet is private or public. We recommend that you don't rely on this behavior. Rather, explicitly add the private or public role tags. The [.noloc]`{aws} Load Balancer Controller` doesn't examine route tables. It also requires the private and public tags to be present for successful auto discovery.


* The https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/aws-load-balancer-controller[{aws} Load Balancer Controller] creates ALBs and the necessary supporting {aws} resources whenever a [.noloc]`Kubernetes` ingress resource is created on the cluster with the `kubernetes.io/ingress.class: alb` annotation. The ingress resource configures the ALB to route HTTP or HTTPS traffic to different [.noloc]`Pods` within the cluster. To ensure that your ingress objects use the [.noloc]`{aws} Load Balancer Controller`, add the following annotation to your [.noloc]`Kubernetes` ingress specification. For more information, see https://kubernetes-sigs.github.io/aws-load-balancer-controller/v2.7/guide/ingress/spec/[Ingress specification] on [.noloc]`GitHub`.
+
[source,yaml,subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
annotations:
    kubernetes.io/ingress.class: alb
----
+
NOTE: If you're load balancing to `IPv6` [.noloc]`Pods`, add the following annotation to your ingress spec. You can only load balance over `IPv6` to IP targets, not instance targets. Without this annotation, load balancing is over `IPv4`.

[source,yaml,subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/ip-address-type: dualstack
----
* The [.noloc]`{aws} Load Balancer Controller` supports the following traffic modes:
+
** *Instance*
 – Registers nodes within your cluster as targets for the ALB. Traffic reaching the ALB is routed to `NodePort` for your service and then proxied to your [.noloc]`Pods`. This is the default traffic mode. You can also explicitly specify it with the `alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/target-type: instance` annotation.
+
NOTE: Your [.noloc]`Kubernetes` service must specify the `NodePort` or "LoadBalancer" type to use this traffic mode.
** *IP*
 – Registers [.noloc]`Pods` as targets for the ALB. Traffic reaching the ALB is directly routed to [.noloc]`Pods` for your service. You must specify the `alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/target-type: ip` annotation to use this traffic mode. The IP target type is required when target [.noloc]`Pods` are running on Fargate or Amazon EKS Hybrid Nodes.
* To tag ALBs created by the controller, add the following annotation to the controller: `alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/tags`. For a list of all available annotations supported by the [.noloc]`{aws} Load Balancer Controller`, see https://kubernetes-sigs.github.io/aws-load-balancer-controller/v2.7/guide/ingress/annotations/[Ingress annotations] on [.noloc]`GitHub`.
* Upgrading or downgrading the ALB controller version can introduce breaking changes for features that rely on it. For more information about the breaking changes that are introduced in each release, see the https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/aws-load-balancer-controller/releases[ALB controller release notes] on [.noloc]`GitHub`.


== Reuse ALBs with Ingress Groups

You can share an application load balancer across multiple service resources using `IngressGroups`.

To join an ingress to a group, add the following annotation to a [.noloc]`Kubernetes` ingress resource specification.  

[source,yaml,subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/group.name: my-group
----

The group name must:



* Be 63 or fewer characters in length.
* Consist of lower case letters, numbers, `-`, and `.`
* Start and end with a letter or number.

The controller automatically merges ingress rules for all ingresses in the same ingress group. It supports them with a single ALB. Most annotations that are defined on an ingress only apply to the paths defined by that ingress. By default, ingress resources don't belong to any ingress group.

[WARNING]
====

*Potential security risk*

Specify an ingress group for an ingress only when all the [.noloc]`Kubernetes` users that have RBAC permission to create or modify ingress resources are within the same trust boundary. If you add the annotation with a group name, other [.noloc]`Kubernetes` users might create or modify their ingresses to belong to the same ingress group. Doing so can cause undesirable behavior, such as overwriting existing rules with higher priority rules.  

====

You can add an order number of your ingress resource.

[source,yaml,subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/group.order: '10'
----

The number can be 1-1000. The lowest number for all ingresses in the same ingress group is evaluated first. All ingresses without this annotation are evaluated with a value of zero. Duplicate rules with a higher number can overwrite rules with a lower number. By default, the rule order between ingresses within the same ingress group is determined lexicographically based namespace and name.

[IMPORTANT]
====

Ensure that each ingress in the same ingress group has a unique priority number. You can't have duplicate order numbers across ingresses.

== (Optional) Deploy a sample application

* At least one public or private subnet in your cluster VPC.
* Have the [.noloc]`{aws} Load Balancer Controller` deployed on your cluster. For more information, see <<aws-load-balancer-controller>>. We recommend version `2.7.2` or later.

You can run the sample application on a cluster that has Amazon EC2 nodes, Fargate [.noloc]`Pods`, or both.

. If you're not deploying to Fargate, skip this step. If you're deploying to Fargate, create a Fargate profile. You can create the profile by running the following command or in the <<create-fargate-profile,{aws-management-console}>> using the same values for `name` and `namespace` that are in the command. Replace the [.replaceable]`example values` with your own.
+
[source,bash,subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
eksctl create fargateprofile \
    --cluster my-cluster \
    --region region-code \
    --name alb-sample-app \
    --namespace game-2048
----
. Deploy the game https://play2048.co/[2048] as a sample application to verify that the [.noloc]`{aws} Load Balancer Controller` creates an {aws} ALB as a result of the ingress object. Complete the steps for the type of subnet you're deploying to.
+
.. If you're deploying to [.noloc]`Pods` in a cluster that you created with the `IPv6` family, skip to the next step.
+
