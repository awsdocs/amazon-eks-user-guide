Learn to connect and manage [.noloc]`Kubernetes` clusters outside {aws} with Amazon EKS Connector, enabling unified cluster visibility and management across environments using a secure, outbound-only connection.

.Q: How does the underlying technology behind the Amazon EKS Connector work?
A: The Amazon EKS Connector is based on the {aws} Systems Manager (Systems Manager) agent. The Amazon EKS Connector runs as a `StatefulSet` on your [.noloc]`Kubernetes` cluster. It establishes a connection and proxies the communication between the API server of your cluster and Amazon Web Services. It does this to display cluster data in the Amazon EKS console until you disconnect the cluster from {aws}. The Systems Manager agent is an open source project. For more information about this project, see the https://github.com/aws/amazon-ssm-agent[GitHub project page].

.Q: I have an on-premises [.noloc]`Kubernetes` cluster that I want to connect. Do I need to open firewall ports to connect it?
A: No, you don't need to open any firewall ports. The [.noloc]`Kubernetes` cluster only requires outbound connection to {aws} Regions. {aws} services never access resources in your on-premises network. The Amazon EKS Connector runs on your cluster and initiates the connection to {aws}. When the cluster registration completes, {aws} only issues commands to the Amazon EKS Connector after you start an action from the Amazon EKS console that requires information from the [.noloc]`Kubernetes` API server on your cluster.

.Q: What data is sent from my cluster to {aws} by the Amazon EKS Connector?
A: The Amazon EKS Connector sends technical information that's necessary for your cluster to be registered on {aws}. It also sends cluster and workload metadata for the Amazon EKS console features that customers request. The Amazon EKS Connector only gathers or sends this data if you start an action from the Amazon EKS console or the Amazon EKS API that necessitates the data to be sent to {aws}. Other than the [.noloc]`Kubernetes` version number, {aws} doesn't store any data by default. It stores data only if you authorize it to.

.Q: Can I connect a cluster outside of an {aws} Region?
A: Yes, you can connect a cluster from any location to Amazon EKS. Moreover, your Amazon EKS service can be located in any {aws} public commercial {aws} Region. This works with a valid network connection from your cluster to the target {aws} Region. We recommend that you pick an {aws} Region that is closest to your cluster location for UI performance optimization. For example, if you have a cluster running in Tokyo, connect your cluster to the {aws} Region in Tokyo (that is, the `ap-northeast-1` {aws} Region) for low latency. You can connect a cluster from any location to Amazon EKS in any of the public commercial {aws} Regions, except the China or GovCloud {aws} Regions.
