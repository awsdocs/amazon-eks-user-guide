Learn how to configure networking for your Amazon EKS cluster using a VPC, subnets, security groups, and networking add-ons to ensure secure and efficient communication.

Your Amazon EKS cluster is created in a VPC. Pod networking is provided by the Amazon VPC Container Network Interface (CNI) plugin for nodes that run on {aws} infrastructure. If you are running nodes on your own infrastructure, see <<hybrid-nodes-cni>>. This chapter includes the following topics for learning more about networking for your cluster.
