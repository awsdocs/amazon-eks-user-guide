:info_title: Train and serve TensorFlow models on EKS with Deep Learning Containers

{aws} Deep Learning Containers are a set of [.noloc]`Docker` images for training and serving models in TensorFlow on Amazon EKS and Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS). Deep Learning Containers provide optimized environments with https://www.tensorflow.org/[TensorFlow], https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-zone[NVIDIA CUDA] (for GPU instances), and https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/tools/oneapi/onemkl.html[Intel MKL] (for CPU instances) libraries and are available in Amazon ECR.

To get started using {aws} Deep Learning Containers on Amazon EKS, see link:dlami/latest/devguide/deep-learning-containers-eks.html[Amazon EKS Setup,type="documentation"] in the _{aws} Deep Learning Containers Developer Guide_.
