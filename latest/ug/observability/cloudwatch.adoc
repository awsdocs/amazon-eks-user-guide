With Amazon CloudWatch, you can view metrics, real-time logs, and trace data.

Amazon CloudWatch is a monitoring service that collects metrics and logs from your cloud resources. CloudWatch provides some basic Amazon EKS metrics for free when using a new cluster that is version `1.28` and above. However, when using the CloudWatch Observability Operator as an Amazon EKS add-on, you can gain enhanced observability features.

== Basic metrics in Amazon CloudWatch

For new clusters that are [.noloc]`Kubernetes` version `1.28` and above, you get CloudWatch vended metrics for free in the `AWS/EKS` namespace. Basic metrics are also available for existing clusters that have a platform version that is the same or later compared to the following table.

[cols="1,1", options="header"]
|===
|Kubernetes version
|Platform version

|`1.31`
|`eks.12`

|`1.30`
|`eks.20`

|`1.29`
|`eks.23`

|`1.28`
|`eks.29`

|===

The following table gives a list of the basic metrics that are available for the supported versions. Every metric listed has a frequency of one minute.

== [.noloc]`Amazon CloudWatch Observability Operator`

[.noloc]`Amazon CloudWatch Observability` collects real-time logs, metrics, and trace data. It sends them to link:AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/WhatIsCloudWatch.html[Amazon CloudWatch,type="documentation"] and link:xray/latest/devguide/aws-xray.html[{aws} X-Ray,type="documentation"]. You can install this add-on to enable both CloudWatch Application Signals and CloudWatch [.noloc]`Container Insights` with enhanced observability for Amazon EKS. This helps you monitor the health and performance of your infrastructure and containerized applications. The Amazon CloudWatch Observability Operator is designed to install and configure the necessary components.

Amazon EKS supports the CloudWatch Observability Operator as an <<eks-add-ons,Amazon EKS add-on>>. The add-on allows [.noloc]`Container Insights` on both [.noloc]`Linux` and [.noloc]`Windows` worker nodes in the cluster. To enable [.noloc]`Container Insights` on [.noloc]`Windows`, the Amazon EKS add-on version must be `1.5.0` or higher. Currently, CloudWatch Application Signals isn't supported on Amazon EKS [.noloc]`Windows`.

The topics below describe how to get started using CloudWatch Observability Operator for your Amazon EKS cluster.

* For instructions on installing this add-on, see link:AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/install-CloudWatch-Observability-EKS-addon.html[Install the CloudWatch agent with the Amazon CloudWatch Observability EKS add-on or the Helm chart,type="documentation"] in the _Amazon CloudWatch User Guide_.
* For more information about CloudWatch Application Signals, see link:AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch-Application-Monitoring-Sections.html[Application Signals,type="documentation"] in the _Amazon CloudWatch User Guide_.
