The {aws} Distro for OpenTelemetry (ADOT) Operator makes it easier to enable your applications running on Amazon EKS to send metric and trace data to multiple monitoring service options.

Amazon EKS supports using the {aws-management-console}, {aws} CLI and Amazon EKS API to install and manage the https://aws-otel.github.io/[{aws} Distro for OpenTelemetry (ADOT)] Operator. This makes it easier to enable your applications running on Amazon EKS to send metric and trace data to multiple monitoring service options like link:cloudwatch[Amazon CloudWatch,type="console"], link:prometheus[Prometheus,type="console"], and link:xray[X-Ray,type="console"].

For more information, see https://aws-otel.github.io/docs/getting-started/adot-eks-add-on[Getting Started with {aws} Distro for OpenTelemetry using EKS Add-Ons] in the {aws} Distro for [.noloc]`OpenTelemetry` documentation.
