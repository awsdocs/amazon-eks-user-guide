= Prevent [.noloc]`Pods` from being scheduled on specific nodes
:info_titleabbrev: Taint GPU nodes

[abstract]
--
Taints and tolerations work together to ensure that [.noloc]`Pods` aren't scheduled onto inappropriate nodes. This can be particularly useful for nodes running on GPU hardware.
--

Nodes with specialized processors, such as GPUs, can be more expensive to run than nodes running on more standard machines.
For that reason, you may want to protect those nodes from having workloads that don't require special hardware from being deployed to those nodes.
One way to do that is with taints.

Amazon EKS supports configuring [.noloc]`Kubernetes` taints through managed node groups. Taints and tolerations work together to ensure that [.noloc]`Pods` aren't scheduled onto inappropriate nodes. One or more taints can be applied to a node. This marks that the node shouldn't accept any [.noloc]`Pods` that don't tolerate the taints. Tolerations are applied to [.noloc]`Pods` and allow, but don't require, the [.noloc]`Pods` to schedule onto nodes with matching taints. For more information, see https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/taint-and-toleration/[Taints and Tolerations] in the [.noloc]`Kubernetes` documentation.

[.noloc]`Kubernetes` node taints can be applied to new and existing managed node groups using the {aws-management-console} or through the Amazon EKS API.



* For information on creating a node group with a taint using the {aws-management-console}, see <<create-managed-node-group>>.
* The following is an example of creating a node group with a taint using the {aws} CLI:
+
[source,bash,subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
aws eks create-nodegroup \
 --cli-input-json '
{
  "clusterName": "my-cluster",
  "nodegroupName": "node-taints-example",
  "subnets": [
     "subnet-1234567890abcdef0",
     "subnet-abcdef01234567890",
     "subnet-021345abcdef67890"
   ],
  "nodeRole": "{arn-aws}iam::111122223333:role/AmazonEKSNodeRole",
  "taints": [
     {
         "key": "dedicated",
         "value": "gpuGroup",
         "effect": "NO_SCHEDULE"
     }
   ]
}'

For more information and examples of usage, see https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubectl/kubectl-commands#taint[taint] in the [.noloc]`Kubernetes` reference documentation.

[NOTE]
====


* Taints can be updated after you create the node group using the `UpdateNodegroupConfig` API.
* The taint key must begin with a letter or number. It can contain letters, numbers, hyphens (`-`), periods (`.`), and underscores (`_`). It can be up to 63 characters long.
* Optionally, the taint key can begin with a DNS subdomain prefix and a single `/`. If it begins with a DNS subdomain prefix, it can be 253 characters long.
* The value is optional and must begin with a letter or number. It can contain letters, numbers, hyphens (`-`), periods (`.`), and underscores (`_`). It can be up to 63 characters long.
* When using [.noloc]`Kubernetes` directly or the {aws-management-console}, the taint effect must be `NoSchedule`, `PreferNoSchedule`, or `NoExecute`. However, when using the {aws} CLI or API, the taint effect must be `NO_SCHEDULE`, `PREFER_NO_SCHEDULE`, or `NO_EXECUTE`.
* A maximum of 50 taints are allowed per node group.
* If taints that were created using a managed node group are removed manually from a node, then Amazon EKS doesn't add the taints back to the node. This is true even if the taints are specified in the managed node group configuration.

You can use the link:cli/latest/reference/eks/update-nodegroup-config.html[aws eks update-nodegroup-config,type="documentation"] {aws} CLI command to add, remove, or replace taints for managed node groups.
