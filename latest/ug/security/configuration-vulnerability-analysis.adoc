Learn how to analyze the security configuration and vulnerabilities of your Amazon EKS clusters and resources using tools like the CIS EKS Benchmark, platform versions, vulnerability lists, Amazon Inspector, and Amazon GuardDuty for comprehensive threat detection and protection.

Security is a critical consideration for configuring and maintaining [.noloc]`Kubernetes` clusters and applications. The following lists resources for you to analyze the security configuration of your EKS clusters, resources for you to check for vulnerabilities, and integrations with {aws} services that can do that analysis for you.

== The Center for Internet Security (CIS) benchmark for Amazon EKS

The https://www.cisecurity.org/benchmark/kubernetes/[Center for Internet Security (CIS) Kubernetes Benchmark] provides guidance for Amazon EKS security configurations. The benchmark:



* Is applicable to Amazon EC2 nodes (both managed and self-managed) where you are responsible for security configurations of [.noloc]`Kubernetes` components.  
* Provides a standard, community-approved way to ensure that you have configured your [.noloc]`Kubernetes` cluster and nodes securely when using Amazon EKS.
* Consists of four sections; control plane logging configuration, node security configurations, policies, and managed services.
* Supports all of the [.noloc]`Kubernetes` versions currently available in Amazon EKS and can be run using https://github.com/aquasecurity/kube-bench[kube-bench], a standard open source tool for checking configuration using the CIS benchmark on [.noloc]`Kubernetes` clusters.

== Amazon EKS platform versions

Amazon EKS  _platform versions_ represent the capabilities of the cluster control plane, including which [.noloc]`Kubernetes` API server flags are enabled and the current [.noloc]`Kubernetes` patch version. New clusters are deployed with the latest platform version. For details, see <<platform-versions>>.

You can <<update-cluster,update an Amazon EKS cluster>> to newer [.noloc]`Kubernetes` versions. As new [.noloc]`Kubernetes` versions become available in Amazon EKS, we recommend that you proactively update your clusters to use the latest available version. For more information about [.noloc]`Kubernetes` versions in EKS, see <<kubernetes-versions>>.

== Node detection with Amazon Inspector

You can use   link:inspector/latest/userguide/inspector_introduction.html[Amazon Inspector,type="documentation"] to check for unintended network accessibility of your nodes and for vulnerabilities on those Amazon EC2 instances.

== Cluster and node detection with Amazon GuardDuty

Amazon GuardDuty threat detection service that helps protect your accounts, containers, workloads, and the data within your {aws} environment. Among other features, GuardDuty offers the following two features that detect potential threats to your EKS clusters:  _EKS Protection_ and _Runtime Monitoring_.

For more information, see <<integration-guardduty>>.
