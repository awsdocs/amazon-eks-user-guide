== Infrastructure security in Amazon EKS

[abstract]
--
Learn how Amazon EKS isolates service traffic.
--

As a managed service, Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service is protected by {aws} global network security. For information about {aws} security services and how {aws} protects infrastructure, see link:security/[{aws} Cloud Security,type="marketing"]. To design your {aws} environment using the best practices for infrastructure security, see link:wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/infrastructure-protection.html[Infrastructure Protection,type="documentation"] in _Security Pillar {aws} Well‚ÄêArchitected Framework_.

You use {aws} published API calls to access Amazon EKS through the network. Clients must support the following:



* Transport Layer Security (TLS). We require TLS 1.2 and recommend TLS 1.3.
* Cipher suites with perfect forward secrecy (PFS) such as DHE (Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman) or ECDHE (Elliptic Curve Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman). Most modern systems such as Java 7 and later support these modes.

Additionally, requests must be signed by using an access key ID and a secret access key that is associated with an IAM principal. Or you can use the link:STS/latest/APIReference/welcome.html[{aws} Security Token Service,type="documentation"] ({aws} STS) to generate temporary security credentials to sign requests.

When you create an Amazon EKS cluster, you specify the VPC subnets for your cluster to use. Amazon EKS requires subnets in at least two Availability Zones. We recommend a VPC with public and private subnets so that [.noloc]`Kubernetes` can create public load balancers in the public subnets that load balance traffic to [.noloc]`Pods` running on nodes that are in private subnets.

For more information about VPC considerations, see <<network-reqs>>.

If you create your VPC and node groups with the {aws} CloudFormation templates provided in the <<getting-started,Get started with Amazon EKS>> walkthrough, then your control plane and node security groups are configured with our recommended settings.

For more information about security group considerations, see <<sec-group-reqs>>. 

When you create a new cluster, Amazon EKS creates an endpoint for the managed [.noloc]`Kubernetes` API server that you use to communicate with your cluster (using [.noloc]`Kubernetes` management tools such as `kubectl`). By default, this API server endpoint is public to the internet, and access to the API server is secured using a combination of {aws} Identity and Access Management (IAM) and native [.noloc]`Kubernetes` https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/[Role Based Access Control] (RBAC).

You can enable private access to the [.noloc]`Kubernetes` API server so that all communication between your nodes and the API server stays within your VPC. You can limit the IP addresses that can access your API server from the internet, or completely disable internet access to the API server.

For more information about modifying cluster endpoint access, see <<modify-endpoint-access>>.

You can implement [.noloc]`Kubernetes` _network policies_ with the Amazon VPC CNI or third-party tools such as https://docs.tigera.io/calico/latest/about/[Project Calico]. For more information about using the Amazon VPC CNI for network policies, see <<cni-network-policy>>. Project [.noloc]`Calico` is a third party open source project. For more information, see the https://docs.tigera.io/calico/latest/getting-started/kubernetes/managed-public-cloud/eks/[Project Calico documentation].

=== Access the Amazon EKS using {aws} PrivateLink

[abstract]
--
Learn how to securely access Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) APIs from within your VPC using {aws} PrivateLink, avoiding public internet exposure while benefiting from private connectivity, routing optimization, and built-in security controls for enhanced cluster management.
--

You can use {aws} PrivateLink to create a private connection between your VPC and Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service. You can access Amazon EKS as if it were in your VPC, without the use of an internet gateway, NAT device, VPN connection, or {aws} Direct Connect connection. Instances in your VPC don't need public IP addresses to access Amazon EKS.

You establish this private connection by creating an interface endpoint powered by {aws} PrivateLink. We create an endpoint network interface in each subnet that you enable for the interface endpoint. These are requester-managed network interfaces that serve as the entry point for traffic destined for Amazon EKS.

For more information, see link:vpc/latest/privatelink/privatelink-access-aws-services.html[Access {aws} services through {aws} PrivateLink,type="documentation"] in the _{aws} PrivateLink Guide_.

==== Considerations for Amazon EKS

* Before you set up an interface endpoint for Amazon EKS, review  link:vpc/latest/privatelink/create-interface-endpoint.html#considerations-interface-endpoints[Considerations,type="documentation"] in the _{aws} PrivateLink Guide_.
* Amazon EKS supports making calls to all of its API actions through the interface endpoint, but not to the [.noloc]`Kubernetes` APIs. The [.noloc]`Kubernetes` API server already supports a  <<cluster-endpoint,private endpoint>>. The [.noloc]`Kubernetes` API server private endpoint creates a private endpoint for the [.noloc]`Kubernetes` API server that you use to communicate with your cluster (using [.noloc]`Kubernetes` management tools such as `kubectl`). You can enable <<private-clusters,private access>> to the [.noloc]`Kubernetes` API server so that all communication between your nodes and the API server stays within your VPC. {aws} PrivateLink for the Amazon EKS API helps you call the Amazon EKS APIs from your VPC without exposing traffic to the public internet.
* You can't configure Amazon EKS to only be accessed through an interface endpoint.
* Standard pricing for {aws} PrivateLink applies for interface endpoints for Amazon EKS. You are billed for every hour that an interface endpoint is provisioned in each Availability Zone and for data processed through the interface endpoint. For more information, see link:privatelink/pricing/[{aws} PrivateLink pricing,type="marketing"].
* VPC endpoint policies are not supported for Amazon EKS. By default, full access to Amazon EKS is allowed through the interface endpoint. Alternatively, you can associate a security group with the endpoint network interfaces to control traffic to Amazon EKS through the interface endpoint.
* You can use VPC flow logs to capture information about IP traffic going to and from network interfaces, including interface endpoints. You can publish flow log data to Amazon CloudWatch or Amazon S3. For more information, see link:vpc/latest/userguide/flow-logs.html[Logging IP traffic using VPC Flow Logs,type="documentation"] in the Amazon VPC User Guide.
* You can access the Amazon EKS APIs from an on-premises data center by connecting it to a VPC that has an interface endpoint. You can use {aws} Direct Connect or {aws} Site-to-Site VPN to connect your on-premises sites to a VPC.
* You can connect other VPCs to the VPC with an interface endpoint using an {aws} Transit Gateway or VPC peering. VPC peering is a networking connection between two VPCs. You can establish a  VPC peering connection between your VPCs, or with a VPC in another account. The VPCs can be in different {aws} Regions. Traffic between peered VPCs stays on the {aws} network. The traffic doesn't traverse the public internet. A Transit Gateway is a network transit hub that you can use to interconnect VPCs. Traffic between a VPC and a Transit Gateway remains on the {aws} global private network. The traffic isn't exposed to the public internet.
* Before August 2024, VPC interface endpoints for Amazon EKS were only accessible over `IPv4` using `eks.[.replaceable]``region``.amazonaws.com`. New VPC interface endpoints that are made after August 2024 use dual-stack of `IPv4` and `IPv6` IP addresses and both DNS names: `eks.[.replaceable]``region``.amazonaws.com` and `eks.[.replaceable]``region``.api.aws`.
* {aws} PrivateLink support for the EKS API isn't available in the Asia Pacific (Malaysia) {aws} Region. {aws} PrivateLink support for `eks-auth` for EKS Pod Identity is available in the Asia Pacific (Malaysia) {aws} Region. 


[[vpc-endpoint-create,vpc-endpoint-create.title]]
==== Create an interface endpoint for Amazon EKS

You can create an interface endpoint for Amazon EKS using either the Amazon VPC console or the {aws} Command Line Interface ({aws} CLI). For more information, see   link:vpc/latest/privatelink/create-interface-endpoint.html#create-interface-endpoint-aws[Create a VPC endpoint,type="documentation"] in the _{aws} PrivateLink Guide_.

Create an interface endpoint for Amazon EKS using the following service names:



* 
[source,none,subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
com.amazonaws.region-code.eks
----
* 
[source,none,subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
com.amazonaws.region-code.eks-auth
----

The private DNS feature is enabled by default when creating an interface endpoint for Amazon EKS and other {aws} services. To use the private DNS feature, you must ensure that the following VPC attributes are set to `true`: `enableDnsHostnames` and `enableDnsSupport`. For more information, see  link:vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-dns.html#vpc-dns-updating[View and update DNS attributes for your VPC,type="documentation"] in the Amazon VPC User Guide. With the private DNS feature enabled for the interface endpoint:



* You can make any API request to Amazon EKS using its default Regional DNS name. After August 2024, any new VPC interface endpoint for the Amazon EKS API have two default Regional DNS names and you can choose the `dualstack` for the IP address type. The first DNS name is `eks.[.replaceable]``region``.api.aws` which is dual-stack. It resolves to both `IPv4` addresses and `IPv6` addresses. Before August 2024, Amazon EKS only used `eks.[.replaceable]``region``.amazonaws.com` which resolved to `IPv4` addresses only. If you want to use `IPv6` and dual-stack IP addresses with an existing VPC interface endpoint, you can update the endpoint to use the `dualstack` type of IP address, but it will only have the `eks.[.replaceable]``region``.amazonaws.com` DNS name. In this configuration, the existing endpoint updates to point that name to both `IPv4` and `IPv6` IP addresses. For a list of APIs, see   link:eks/latest/APIReference/API_Operations.html[Actions,type="documentation"] in the Amazon EKS API Reference.
* You don't need to make any changes to your applications that call the EKS APIs.
+
However, To use the dual-stack endpoints with the {aws} CLI, see the link:sdkref/latest/guide/feature-endpoints.html[Dual-stack and FIPS endpoints,type="documentation"] configuration in the _{aws} SDKs and Tools Reference Guide_.
* Any call made to the Amazon EKS default service endpoint is automatically routed through the interface endpoint over the private {aws} network.

== Understand resilience in Amazon EKS clusters

[abstract]
--
Learn how Amazon EKS ensures high availability, data resilience, and fault tolerance for your [.noloc]`Kubernetes` control plane by leveraging {aws} infrastructure across multiple Availability Zones .
--

The {aws} global infrastructure is built around {aws} Regions and Availability Zones. {aws} Regions provide multiple physically separated and isolated Availability Zones, which are connected with low-latency, high-throughput, and highly redundant networking. With Availability Zones, you can design and operate applications and databases that automatically fail over between Availability Zones without interruption. Availability Zones are more highly available, fault tolerant, and scalable than traditional single or multiple data center infrastructures.  

Amazon EKS runs and scales the [.noloc]`Kubernetes` control plane across multiple {aws} Availability Zones to ensure high availability. Amazon EKS automatically scales control plane instances based on load, detects and replaces unhealthy control plane instances, and automatically patches the control plane. After you initiate a version update, Amazon EKS updates your control plane for you, maintaining high availability of the control plane during the update.

This control plane consists of at least two API server instances and three `etcd` instances that run across three Availability Zones within an {aws} Region. Amazon EKS:



* Actively monitors the load on control plane instances and automatically scales them to ensure high performance.
* Automatically detects and replaces unhealthy control plane instances, restarting them across the Availability Zones within the {aws} Region as needed.
* Leverages the architecture of {aws} Regions in order to maintain high availability. Because of this, Amazon EKS is able to offer an link:eks/sla[SLA for API server endpoint availability,type="marketing"].
