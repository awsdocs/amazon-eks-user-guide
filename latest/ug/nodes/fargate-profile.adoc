= Define which [.noloc]`Pods` use {aws} Fargate when launched
:info_titleabbrev: Define profiles

[abstract]
--
Before you schedule [.noloc]`Pods` on Fargate in your cluster, you must define at least one Fargate profile that specifies which [.noloc]`Pods` use Fargate when launched.
--

[IMPORTANT]
====

{aws} Fargate with Amazon EKS isn't available in {aws} GovCloud (US-East) and {aws} GovCloud (US-West).

====

Before you schedule [.noloc]`Pods` on Fargate in your cluster, you must define at least one Fargate profile that specifies which [.noloc]`Pods` use Fargate when launched.

As an administrator, you can use a Fargate profile to declare which [.noloc]`Pods` run on Fargate. You can do this through the profile's selectors. You can add up to five selectors to each profile. Each selector must contain a namespace. The selector can also include labels. The label field consists of multiple optional key-value pairs. Pods that match a selector are scheduled on Fargate. Pods are matched using a namespace and the labels that are specified in the selector. If a namespace selector is defined without labels, Amazon EKS attempts to schedule all the [.noloc]`Pods` that run in that namespace onto Fargate using the profile. If a to-be-scheduled [.noloc]`Pod` matches any of the selectors in the Fargate profile, then that [.noloc]`Pod` is scheduled on Fargate.

If a [.noloc]`Pod` matches multiple Fargate profiles, you can specify which profile a [.noloc]`Pod` uses by adding the following [.noloc]`Kubernetes` label to the [.noloc]`Pod` specification: `eks.amazonaws.com/fargate-profile: [.replaceable]``my-fargate-profile```. The [.noloc]`Pod` must match a selector in that profile to be scheduled onto Fargate. [.noloc]`Kubernetes` affinity/anti-affinity rules do not apply and aren't necessary with Amazon EKS Fargate [.noloc]`Pods`.

When you create a Fargate profile, you must specify a [.noloc]`Pod` execution role. This execution role is for the Amazon EKS components that run on the Fargate infrastructure using the profile. It's added to the cluster's [.noloc]`Kubernetes` https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/[Role Based Access Control] (RBAC) for authorization. That way, the `kubelet` that runs on the Fargate infrastructure can register with your Amazon EKS cluster and appear in your cluster as a node. The [.noloc]`Pod` execution role also provides IAM permissions to the Fargate infrastructure to allow read access to Amazon ECR image repositories. For more information, see <<pod-execution-role>>.

Fargate profiles can't be changed. However, you can create a new updated profile to replace an existing profile, and then delete the original.

[NOTE]
====

Any [.noloc]`Pods` that are running using a Fargate profile are stopped and put into a pending state when the profile is deleted.

====

If any Fargate profiles in a cluster are in the `DELETING` status, you must wait until after the Fargate profile is deleted before you create other profiles in that cluster.

Amazon EKS and Fargate spread [.noloc]`Pods` across each of the subnets that's defined in the Fargate profile. However, you might end up with an uneven spread. If you must have an even spread, use two Fargate profiles. Even spread is important in scenarios where you want to deploy two replicas and don't want any downtime. We recommend that each profile has only one subnet.

[[fargate-profile-components,fargate-profile-components.title]]
== Fargate profile components

The following components are contained in a Fargate profile.



*Pod execution role*::
When your cluster creates [.noloc]`Pods` on {aws} Fargate, the `kubelet` that's running on the Fargate infrastructure must make calls to {aws} APIs on your behalf. For example, it needs to make calls to pull container images from Amazon ECR. The Amazon EKS [.noloc]`Pod` execution role provides the IAM permissions to do this.
+
When you create a Fargate profile, you must specify a [.noloc]`Pod` execution role to use with your [.noloc]`Pods`. This role is added to the cluster's [.noloc]`Kubernetes` https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/[Role-based access control] (RBAC) for authorization. This is so that the `kubelet` that's running on the Fargate infrastructure can register with your Amazon EKS cluster and appear in your cluster as a node. For more information, see <<pod-execution-role>>.


*Subnets*::
The IDs of subnets to launch [.noloc]`Pods` into that use this profile. At this time, [.noloc]`Pods` that are running on Fargate aren't assigned public IP addresses. Therefore, only private subnets with no direct route to an Internet Gateway are accepted for this parameter.


*Selectors*::
The selectors to match for [.noloc]`Pods` to use this Fargate profile. You might specify up to five selectors in a Fargate profile. The selectors have the following components:
+
** *Namespace* – You must specify a namespace for a selector. The selector only matches [.noloc]`Pods` that are created in this namespace. However, you can create multiple selectors to target multiple namespaces.
** *Labels* – You can optionally specify [.noloc]`Kubernetes` labels to match for the selector. The selector only matches [.noloc]`Pods` that have all of the labels that are specified in the selector.


[[fargate-profile-wildcards,fargate-profile-wildcards.title]]
== Fargate profile wildcards

In addition to characters allowed by [.noloc]`Kubernetes`, you're allowed to use `\*` and `?` in the selector criteria for namespaces, label keys, and label values:



* `\*` represents none, one, or multiple characters. For example, `prod*` can represent `prod` and `prod-metrics`.
* `?` represents a single character (for example, `value?` can represent `valuea`). However, it can't represent `value` and `value-a`, because `?` can only represent exactly one character.

These wildcard characters can be used in any position and in combination (for example, `prod*`, `\*dev`, and `frontend*?`). Other wildcards and forms of pattern matching, such as regular expressions, aren't supported.

If there are multiple matching profiles for the namespace and labels in the [.noloc]`Pod` spec, Fargate picks up the profile based on alphanumeric sorting by profile name. For example, if both profile A (with the name `beta-workload`) and profile B (with the name `prod-workload`) have matching selectors for the [.noloc]`Pods` to be launched, Fargate picks profile A (`beta-workload`) for the [.noloc]`Pods`. The [.noloc]`Pods` have labels with profile A on the [.noloc]`Pods` (for example, `eks.amazonaws.com/fargate-profile=beta-workload`).

If you want to migrate existing Fargate [.noloc]`Pods` to new profiles that use wildcards, there are two ways to do so:



* Create a new profile with matching selectors, then delete the old profiles. Pods labeled with old profiles are rescheduled to new matching profiles.
* If you want to migrate workloads but aren't sure what Fargate labels are on each Fargate [.noloc]`Pod`, you can use the following method. Create a new profile with a name that sorts alphanumerically first among the profiles on the same cluster. Then, recycle the Fargate [.noloc]`Pods` that need to be migrated to new profiles.

== Create a Fargate profile

This section describes how to create a Fargate profile. You also must have created a [.noloc]`Pod` execution role to use for your Fargate profile. For more information, see <<pod-execution-role>>. [.noloc]`Pods` that are running on Fargate are only supported on private subnets with link:vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-nat-gateway.html[NAT gateway,type="documentation"] access to {aws} services, but not a direct route to an Internet Gateway. This is so that your cluster's VPC must have private subnets available.

You can create a profile with the following:

* <<eksctl_create_a_fargate_profile>>
* <<console_create_a_fargate_profile>>

== `eksctl` [[eksctl_create_a_fargate_profile]]

*To create a Fargate profile with `eksctl`*

Create your Fargate profile with the following `eksctl` command, replacing every [.replaceable]`example value` with your own values. You're required to specify a namespace. However, the `--labels` option isn't required.

[source,bash,subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
eksctl create fargateprofile \
    --cluster my-cluster \
    --name my-fargate-profile \
    --namespace my-kubernetes-namespace \
    --labels key=value
----

You can use certain wildcards for [.replaceable]`my-kubernetes-namespace` and [.replaceable]`key=value` labels. For more information, see <<fargate-profile-wildcards>>.


== {aws-management-console} [[console_create_a_fargate_profile]]

*To create a Fargate profile with {aws-management-console}*

. Open the link:eks/home#/clusters[Amazon EKS console,type="console"].
. Choose the cluster to create a Fargate profile for.
. Choose the *Compute* tab.
. Under *Fargate profiles*, choose  *Add Fargate profile*.
. On the *Configure Fargate profile* page, do the following:
+
.. For *Name*, enter a unique name for your Fargate profile, such as [.replaceable]`my-profile`.
.. For *Pod execution role*, choose the [.noloc]`Pod` execution role to use with your Fargate profile. Only the IAM roles with the `eks-fargate-pods.amazonaws.com` service principal are shown. If you don't see any roles listed, you must create one. For more information, see <<pod-execution-role>>.
.. Modify the selected *Subnets* as needed.
+
NOTE: Only private subnets are supported for [.noloc]`Pods` that are running on Fargate.
.. For *Tags*, you can optionally tag your Fargate profile. These tags don't propagate to other resources that are associated with the profile, such as [.noloc]`Pods`.
.. Choose *Next*.
. On the *Configure [.noloc]`Pod` selection* page, do the following:
+
.. For *Namespace*, enter a namespace to match for [.noloc]`Pods`.
+
*** You can use specific namespaces to match, such as `kube-system` or `default`.
*** You can use certain wildcards (for example, `prod-*`) to match multiple namespaces (for example, `prod-deployment` and `prod-test`). For more information, see <<fargate-profile-wildcards>>.
.. (Optional) Add [.noloc]`Kubernetes` labels to the selector. Specifically, add them to the one that the [.noloc]`Pods` in the specified namespace need to match.
+
*** You can add the label `infrastructure: fargate` to the selector so that only [.noloc]`Pods` in the specified namespace that also have the `infrastructure: fargate` [.noloc]`Kubernetes` label match the selector.
*** You can use certain wildcards (for example, `key?: value?`) to match multiple namespaces (for example, `keya: valuea` and `keyb: valueb`). For more information, see <<fargate-profile-wildcards>>.
.. Choose *Next*.
. On the *Review and create* page, review the information for your Fargate profile and choose  *Create*.
