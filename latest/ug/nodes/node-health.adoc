You can use the node monitoring agent to show health issues and use node auto repair to automatically replace nodes when issues are detected.

Node health refers to the operational status and capability of a node to effectively run workloads. A healthy node maintains expected connectivity, has sufficient resources, and can successfully run Pods without disruption. For information on getting details about your nodes, see <<learn-status-conditions>>.

To help with maintaining healthy nodes, Amazon EKS offers the node monitoring agent and node auto repair.

[[node-monitoring-agent,node-monitoring-agent.title]]
== Node monitoring agent

The node monitoring agent automatically reads node logs to detect certain health issues. It parses through node logs to detect failures and surfaces various status information about worker nodes. A dedicated `NodeCondition` is applied on the worker nodes for each category of issues detected, such as storage and networking issues. Descriptions of detected health issues are made available in the observability dashboard. For more information, see <<observability-node-health-issues>>.

The node monitoring agent is included as a capability for all Amazon EKS Auto Mode clusters. For other cluster types, you can add the monitoring agent as an Amazon EKS add-on. For more information, see <<creating-an-add-on>>.

[[node-auto-repair,node-auto-repair.title]]
== Node auto repair

Node auto repair is an additional feature that continuously monitors the health of nodes, automatically reacting to detected problems and replacing nodes when possible. This helps overall availability of the cluster with minimal manual intervention. If a health check fails, the node is automatically cordoned so that no new Pods are scheduled on the node.

By itself, node auto repair can react to the `Ready` condition of the `kubelet` and any node objects that are manually deleted. When paired with the node monitoring agent, node auto repair can react to more conditions that wouldn't be detected otherwise. These additional conditions include `KernelReady`, `NetworkingReady`, and `StorageReady`.

This automated node recovery automatically addresses intermittent node issues such as failures to join the cluster, unresponsive kubelets, and increased accelerator (device) errors. The improved reliability helps reduce application downtime and improve cluster operations. Node auto repair cannot handle certain problems that are reported such as `DiskPressure`, `MemoryPressure`, and `PIDPressure`. Amazon EKS waits 10 minutes before acting on the `AcceleratedHardwareReady` `NodeConditions`, and 30 minutes for all other conditions.

Managed node groups will also automatically disable node repairs for safety reasons under two scenarios. Any repair operations that are previously in progress will continue for both situations.

* If a zonal shift for your cluster has been triggered through the Application Recovery Controller (ARC), all subsequent repair operations are halted.
* If your node group has more than five nodes and more than 20% of the nodes in your node group are in an unhealthy state, repair operations are halted.

You can enable node auto repair when creating or editing a managed node group.

* When using the Amazon EKS console, activate the *Enable node auto repair* checkbox for the managed node group. For more information, see link:https://quip-amazon.com/wVBsAyVloQdb#temp:C:GBJ0902fb9d71fa47d1b160bd74e[Update to existing user guide topic: Create a managed node group for your cluster].

* When using the {aws} CLI, add the `--node-repair-config enabled=true` to the link:cli/latest/reference/eks/create-nodegroup.html[`eks create nodegroup`,type="documentation"] or link:cli/latest/reference/eks/update-nodegroup-config.html[`eks update-nodegroup-config`, type="documentation"] command.

* For an example `eksctl` `ClusterConfig` that uses a managed node group with node auto repair, see link:https://github.com/eksctl-io/eksctl/blob/main/examples/44-node-repair.yaml[44-node-repair.yaml] on GitHub.

[[node-health-issues,node-health-issues.title]]
== Node health issues

The following tables describe node health issues that can be detected by the node monitoring agent. There are two types of issues:

* Condition – A terminal issue that warrants a remediation action like an instance replacement or reboot. When auto repair is enabled, Amazon EKS will do a repair action, either as a node replacement or reboot. For more information, see <<status-node-conditions>>.

* Event – A temporary issue or sub-optimal node configuration. No auto repair action will take place. For more information, see <<status-node-events>>.

|Name
|Severity
|Description

|ForkFailedOutOfPID
|Condition
|A fork or exec call has failed due to the system being out of process IDs or memory, which may be caused by zombie processes or physical memory exhaustion.

|AppBlocked
|Event
|The task has been blocked for a long period of time from scheduling, usually caused by being blocked on input or output.

|AppCrash
|Event
|An application on the node has crashed.

|ApproachingKernelPidMax
|Event
|The number of processes is approaching the maximum number of PIDs that are available per the current kernel.pid_max setting, after which no more processes can be launched.

|ApproachingMaxOpenFiles
|Event
|The number of open files is approaching the maximum number of possible open files given the current kernel settings, after which opening new files will fail.

|ConntrackExceededKernel
|Event
|Connection tracking exceeded the maximum for the kernel and new connections could not be established, which can result in packet loss.

|ExcessiveZombieProcesses
|Event
|Processes which can't be fully reclaimed are accumulating in large numbers, which indicates application issues and may lead to reaching system process limits.

|KernelBug
|Event
|A kernel bug was detected and reported by the Linux kernel itself, though this may sometimes be caused by nodes with high CPU or memory usage leading to delayed event processing.

|LargeEnvironment
|Event
|The number of environment variables for this process is larger than expected, potentially caused by many services with enableServiceLinks set to true, which may cause performance issues.

|RapidCron
|Event
|A cron job is running faster than every five minutes on this node, which may impact performance if the job consumes significant resources.
