[abstract]
--
Your Amazon EKS cluster can schedule [.noloc]`Pods` on any combination of self-managed nodes, Amazon EKS managed node groups, and Fargate.
--

A [.noloc]`Kubernetes` node is a machine that runs containerized applications. Each node has the following components:

* *https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/production-environment/container-runtimes/[Container runtime]* – Software that's responsible for running the containers.
* *https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/kubelet/[kubelet]* – Makes sure that containers are healthy and running within their associated [.noloc]`Pod`.
* *https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/kube-proxy/[kube-proxy]* – Maintains network rules that allow communication to your [.noloc]`Pods`.

For more information, see https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/nodes/[Nodes] in the [.noloc]`Kubernetes` documentation.

Your Amazon EKS cluster can schedule [.noloc]`Pods` on any combination of <<worker,self-managed nodes>>, <<managed-node-groups,Amazon EKS managed node groups>>, and <<fargate,{aws} Fargate>>. To learn more about nodes deployed in your cluster, see <<view-kubernetes-resources>>.

[IMPORTANT]
====

{aws} Fargate with Amazon EKS isn't available in {aws} GovCloud (US-East) and {aws} GovCloud (US-West).

====

[NOTE]
====

Nodes must be in the same VPC as the subnets you selected when you created the cluster. However, the nodes don't have to be in the same subnets.

====

The following table provides several criteria to evaluate when deciding which options best meet your requirements. This table doesn't include  <<eks-connector,connected nodes>> that were created outside of Amazon EKS, which can only be viewed.

[NOTE]
====

[.noloc]`Bottlerocket` has some specific differences from the general information in this table. For more information, see the [.noloc]`Bottlerocket` https://github.com/bottlerocket-os/bottlerocket/blob/develop/README.md[documentation] on [.noloc]`GitHub`.

|Pods share a kernel runtime environment with other [.noloc]`Pods`
|Yes – All of your [.noloc]`Pods` on each of your nodes
|Yes – All of your [.noloc]`Pods` on each of your nodes
|No – Each [.noloc]`Pod` has a dedicated kernel

|Pods share CPU, memory, storage, and network resources with other [.noloc]`Pods`.
|Yes – Can result in unused resources on each node
|Yes – Can result in unused resources on each node
|No – Each [.noloc]`Pod` has dedicated resources and can be sized independently to maximize resource utilization.  

|Pods can use more hardware and memory than requested in [.noloc]`Pod` specs
|Yes – If the [.noloc]`Pod` requires more resources than requested, and resources are available on the node, the [.noloc]`Pod` can use additional resources.
|Yes – If the [.noloc]`Pod` requires more resources than requested, and resources are available on the node, the [.noloc]`Pod` can use additional resources.
|No – The [.noloc]`Pod` can be re-deployed using a larger vCPU and memory configuration though.

|Must deploy and manage Amazon EC2 instances
|<<create-managed-node-group,Yes>> – automated through Amazon EKS if you deployed an Amazon EKS optimized AMI. If you deployed a custom AMI, then you must update the instance manually.
|Yes – Manual configuration or using Amazon EKS provided {aws} CloudFormation templates to deploy <<launch-workers,Linux (x86)>>, <<arm-ami,Linux (Arm)>>, or <<windows-support,Windows>> nodes.
|No

|Must secure, maintain, and patch the operating system of Amazon EC2 instances
|Yes
|Yes
|No

|Can provide bootstrap arguments at deployment of a node, such as extra https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/kubelet/[kubelet] arguments.
|Yes – Using `eksctl` or a <<launch-templates,launch template>> with a custom AMI
|Yes – For more information, see the https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-eks-ami/blob/main/templates/al2/runtime/bootstrap.sh[bootstrap script usage information] on [.noloc]`GitHub`.
|No

|Can assign IP addresses to [.noloc]`Pods` from a different CIDR block than the IP address assigned to the node.
