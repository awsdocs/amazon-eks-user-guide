Your Amazon EKS cluster can schedule [.noloc]`Pods` on any combination of self-managed nodes, Amazon EKS managed node groups, Fargate, and Amazon EKS Hybrid Nodes in the {aws} Cloud and hybrid nodes on-premises.
--

A [.noloc]`Kubernetes` node is a machine that runs containerized applications. Each node has the following components:

* *https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/production-environment/container-runtimes/[Container runtime]* – Software that's responsible for running the containers.
* *https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/kubelet/[kubelet]* – Makes sure that containers are healthy and running within their associated [.noloc]`Pod`.
* *https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/kube-proxy/[kube-proxy]* – Maintains network rules that allow communication to your [.noloc]`Pods`.

For more information, see https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/nodes/[Nodes] in the [.noloc]`Kubernetes` documentation.

Your Amazon EKS cluster can schedule [.noloc]`Pods` on any combination of <<automode, EKS Auto Mode managed nodes>>, <<worker,self-managed nodes>>, <<managed-node-groups,Amazon EKS managed node groups>>, <<fargate,{aws} Fargate>>, and <<hybrid-nodes-overview,Amazon EKS Hybrid Nodes>>. To learn more about nodes deployed in your cluster, see <<view-kubernetes-resources>>.

[IMPORTANT]
====

{aws} Fargate with Amazon EKS isn't available in {aws} GovCloud (US-East) and {aws} GovCloud (US-West).
Amazon EKS Hybrid Nodes isn't available in {aws} GovCloud Regions and China Regions.

====

[NOTE]
====

Excluding hybrid nodes, nodes must be in the same VPC as the subnets you selected when you created the cluster. However, the nodes don't have to be in the same subnets.

====

== Compare compute options


The following table provides several criteria to evaluate when deciding which options best meet your requirements.

[NOTE]
====

[.noloc]`Bottlerocket` has some specific differences from the general information in this table. For more information, see the [.noloc]`Bottlerocket` https://github.com/bottlerocket-os/bottlerocket/blob/develop/README.md[documentation] on [.noloc]`GitHub`.

|Must deploy and manage Amazon EC2 instances
|Yes
|No - Learn about xref:automode-learn-instances[EC2 managed instances]
|Yes – the on-premises physical or virtual machines are managed by you with your choice of tooling.

|Must secure, maintain, and patch the operating system of Amazon EC2 instances
|Yes
|No
|Yes – the operating system running on your physical or virtual machines are managed by you with your choice of tooling.

|Can provide bootstrap arguments at deployment of a node, such as extra https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/kubelet/[kubelet] arguments.
|Yes – Using `eksctl` or a <<launch-templates,launch template>> with a custom AMI.
|No - xref:create-node-class[Use a `NodeClass` to configure nodes]
|Yes - you can customize bootstrap arguments with nodeadm. See <<hybrid-nodes-nodeadm>>.

|Can assign IP addresses to [.noloc]`Pods` from a different CIDR block than the IP address assigned to the node.
|Yes – Using a launch template with a custom AMI. For more information, see <<launch-templates>>.
|No
|Yes - see <<hybrid-nodes-cni>>.

|Must update node AMI on your own
|<<update-managed-node-group,Yes>> – If you deployed an Amazon EKS optimized AMI, you're notified in the Amazon EKS console when updates are available. You can perform the update with one-click in the console. If you deployed a custom AMI, you're not notified in the Amazon EKS console when updates are available. You must perform the update on your own.
|No
|Yes - the operating system running on your physical or virtual machines is managed by you with your choice of tooling. See <<hybrid-nodes-os>>.

|<<update-managed-node-group,Yes>> – If you deployed an Amazon EKS optimized AMI, you're notified in the Amazon EKS console when updates are available. You can perform the update with one-click in the console. If you deployed a custom AMI, you're not notified in the Amazon EKS console when updates are available. You must perform the update on your own.
|No

| When EKS Auto Mode is enabled in your cluster, you pay a separate fee, in addition to the standard EC2 instance charges, for the instances launched using Auto Mode's compute capability. The amount varies with the instance type launched and the {aws} region where your cluster is located. For more information, see link:eks/pricing/["Amazon EKS pricing",type="marketing"].
