Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) has open-source scripts that are used to build the Amazon EKS optimized AMI. These build scripts are available https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-eks-ami[on GitHub].

The Amazon EKS optimized Amazon Linux AMIs are built on top of Amazon Linux 2 (AL2) and Amazon Linux 2023 (AL2023), specifically for use as a node in Amazon EKS clusters. You can use this repository to view the specifics of how the Amazon EKS team configures `kubelet`, the runtime, the {aws} IAM Authenticator for [.noloc]`Kubernetes`, and build your own Amazon Linux based AMI from scratch.  

The build scripts repository includes a https://www.packer.io/[HashiCorp packer] template and build scripts to generate an AMI. These scripts are the source of truth for Amazon EKS optimized AMI builds, so you can follow the [.noloc]`GitHub` repository to monitor changes to our AMIs. For example, perhaps you want your own AMI to use the same version of [.noloc]`Docker` that the Amazon EKS team uses for the official AMI.  

The [.noloc]`GitHub` repository also contains the specialized https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-eks-ami/blob/main/templates/al2/runtime/bootstrap.sh[bootstrap script] and https://awslabs.github.io/amazon-eks-ami/nodeadm/[nodeadm script] that runs at boot time to configure your instance's certificate data, control plane endpoint, cluster name, and more.

Additionally, the [.noloc]`GitHub` repository contains our Amazon EKS node {aws} CloudFormation templates. These templates make it easier to spin up an instance running an Amazon EKS optimized AMI and register it with a cluster.

For more information, see the repositories on [.noloc]`GitHub` at https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-eks-ami.

Amazon EKS optimized AL2 contains an optional bootstrap flag to enable the `containerd` runtime.
