Prepare cluster access for Amazon EKS hybrid nodes
--

include::../attributes.txt[]

Before connecting hybrid nodes to your Amazon EKS cluster, you must enable your Hybrid Nodes IAM Role with Kubernetes permissions to join the cluster. See <<hybrid-nodes-creds>> for information on how to create the Hybrid Nodes IAM role. Amazon EKS supports two ways to associate IAM principals with Kubernetes Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), Amazon EKS access entries and the `aws-auth` ConfigMap. For more information on Amazon EKS access management, see <<grant-k8s-access>>.

Use the procedures below to associate your Hybrid Nodes IAM role with Kubernetes permissions. To use Amazon EKS access entries, your cluster must have been created with the `API` or `API_AND_CONFIG_MAP` authentication modes. To use the `aws-auth` ConfigMap, your cluster must have been created with the `API_AND_CONFIG_MAP` authentication mode. The `CONFIG_MAP`-only authentication mode is not supported for hybrid nodes-enabled Amazon EKS clusters.

== Using Amazon EKS access entries for Hybrid Nodes IAM role

There is an Amazon EKS access entry type for hybrid nodes named HYBRID_LINUX that can be used with an IAM role. With this access entry type, the username is automatically set to system:node:{{SessionName}}. For more information on creating access entries, see <<creating-access-entries>>.

=== {aws} CLI

. You must have the latest version of the {aws} CLI installed and configured on your device. To check your current version, use `aws --version`. Package managers such yum, apt-get, or Homebrew for macOS are often several versions behind the latest version of the {aws} CLI. To install the latest version, see Installing and Quick configuration with aws configure in the {aws} Command Line Interface User Guide.

. Create your access entry with the following command. Replace CLUSTER_NAME with the name of your cluster and HYBRID_NODES_ROLE_ARN with the ARN of the role you created in the steps for <<hybrid-nodes-creds>>.
+
[source,shell,subs="verbatim,attributes,quotes"]
----
aws eks create-access-entry --cluster-name CLUSTER_NAME \ 
    --principal-arn HYBRID_NODES_ROLE_ARN \
    --type HYBRID_LINUX
----

=== {aws} Management Console

. Open the Amazon EKS console at link:eks/home#/clusters[Amazon EKS console,type="console"].

. Choose the name of your hybrid nodes-enabled cluster.

. Choose the *Access* tab.

. Choose *Create access entry*.

. For *IAM principal*, select the Hybrid Nodes IAM role you created in the steps for <<hybrid-nodes-creds>>.

. For *Type*, select *Hybrid Linux*.

. (Optional) For *Tags*, assign labels to the access entry. For example, to make it easier to find all resources with the same tag.

. Choose *Skip to review and create*. You cannot add policies to the Hybrid Linux access entry or change its access scope.

. Review the configuration for your access entry. If anything looks incorrect, choose *Previous* to go back through the steps and correct the error. If the configuration is correct, choose *Create*.


== Using aws-auth ConfigMap for Hybrid Nodes IAM role

In the following steps, you will create or update the `aws-auth` ConfigMap with the ARN of the Hybrid Nodes IAM Role you created in the steps for <<hybrid-nodes-creds>>. 

. Check to see if you have an existing `aws-auth` ConfigMap for your cluster. Note that if you are using a specific `kubeconfig` file, use the `--kubeconfig` flag.
+
[source,shell,subs="verbatim,attributes,quotes"]
----
kubectl describe configmap -n kube-system aws-auth
----

. If you are shown an `aws-auth` ConfigMap, then update it as needed.
+
.. Open the ConfigMap for editing.
+
[source,shell,subs="verbatim,attributes,quotes"]
----
kubectl edit -n kube-system configmap/aws-auth
----

.. Add a new `mapRoles` entry as needed. Replace `HYBRID_NODES_ROLE_ARN` with the ARN of your Hybrid Nodes IAM role. Note, `{{SessionName}}` is the correct template format to save in the ConfigMap. Do not replace it with other values.
+
[source,yaml,subs="verbatim,attributes,quotes"]
----
data:
  mapRoles: |
  - groups:
    - system:bootstrappers
    - system:nodes
    rolearn: HYBRID_NODES_ROLE_ARN
    username: system:node:{{SessionName}}
----

.. Save the file and exit your text editor.

. If there is not an existing `aws-auth` ConfigMap for your cluster, create it with the following command. Replace `HYBRID_NODES_ROLE_ARN` with the ARN of your Hybrid Nodes IAM role. Note that `{{SessionName}}` is the correct template format to save in the ConfigMap. Do not replace it with other values.
+
[source,shell,subs="verbatim,attributes,quotes"]
----
kubectl apply -f=/dev/stdin <<-EOF
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: aws-auth
  namespace: kube-system

  - groups:
