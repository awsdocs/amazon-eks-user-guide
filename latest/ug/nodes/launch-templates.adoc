= Customize managed nodes with launch templates
:info_titleabbrev: Launch templates

[abstract]
--
For the highest level of customization, you can deploy managed nodes using your own launch template and a custom AMI.
--

For the highest level of customization, you can deploy managed nodes using your own launch template. Using a launch template allows capabilities such as the following:



* Provide bootstrap arguments at deployment of a node, such as extra https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/kubelet/[kubelet] arguments.
* Assign IP addresses to [.noloc]`Pods` from a different CIDR block than the IP address assigned to the node.
* Deploy your own custom AMI to nodes.
* Deploy your own custom CNI to nodes.

When you give your own launch template upon first creating a managed node group, you will also have greater flexibility later. As long as you deploy a managed node group with your own launch template, you can iteratively update it with a different version of the same launch template. When you update your node group to a different version of your launch template, all nodes in the group are recycled to match the new configuration of the specified launch template version.

Managed node groups are always deployed with a launch template to be used with the Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling group. When you don't provide a launch template, the Amazon EKS API creates one automatically with default values in your account. However, we don't recommend that you modify auto-generated launch templates. Furthermore, existing node groups that don't use a custom launch template can't be updated directly. Instead, you must create a new node group with a custom launch template to do so.

[[launch-template-basics,launch-template-basics.title]]
== Launch template configuration basics

You can create an Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling launch template with the {aws-management-console}, {aws} CLI, or an {aws} SDK. For more information, see link:autoscaling/ec2/userguide/create-launch-template.html[Creating a Launch Template for an Auto Scaling group,type="documentation"] in the _Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide_. Some of the settings in a launch template are similar to the settings used for managed node configuration. When deploying or updating a node group with a launch template, some settings must be specified in either the node group configuration or the launch template. Don't specify a setting in both places. If a setting exists where it shouldn't, then operations such as creating or updating a node group fail.

The following table lists the settings that are prohibited in a launch template. It also lists similar settings, if any are available, that are required in the managed node group configuration. The listed settings are the settings that appear in the console. They might have similar but different names in the {aws} CLI and SDK.

[cols="1,1", options="header"]

|*Shutdown behavior* and  *Stop - Hibernate behavior* under  *Advanced details*. Retain default  *Don't include in launch template setting* in launch template for both settings.
|No equivalent. Amazon EKS must control the instance lifecycle, not the Auto Scaling group.

|Amazon EKS node group configuration – Prohibited
|Launch template


|(Only if you specified a custom AMI in a launch template) *AMI type* under  *Node group compute configuration* on  *Set compute and scaling configuration* page – Console displays  *Specified in launch template* and the AMI ID that was specified.

If *Application and OS Images (Amazon Machine Image)* wasn't specified in the launch template, you can select an AMI in the node group configuration.
|*Application and OS Images (Amazon Machine Image)* under  *Launch template contents* – You must specify an ID if you have either of the following requirements:



* Using a custom AMI. If you specify an AMI that doesn't meet the requirements listed in <<launch-template-custom-ami,Specifying an AMI>>, the node group deployment will fail.
* Want to provide user data to provide arguments to the `bootstrap.sh` file included with an Amazon EKS optimized AMI. You can enable your instances to assign a significantly higher number of IP addresses to [.noloc]`Pods`, assign IP addresses to [.noloc]`Pods` from a different CIDR block than the instance's, or deploy a private cluster without outbound internet access. For more information, see the following topics:

|*Disk size* under  *Node group compute configuration* on  *Set compute and scaling configuration* page – Console displays  *Specified in launch template*.
|*Size* under  *Storage (Volumes)* (*Add new volume*). You must specify this in the launch template.

|*SSH key pair* under  *Node group configuration* on the  *Specify Networking* page – The console displays the key that was specified in the launch template or displays  *Not specified in launch template*.
|*Key pair name* under  *Key pair (login)*.

|You can't specify source security groups that are allowed remote access when using a launch template.
|*Security groups* under  *Network settings* for the instance or  *Security groups* under  *Network interfaces* (*Add network interface*), but not both. For more information, see <<launch-template-security-groups>>.
|===

[NOTE]
====


* If you deploy a node group using a launch template, specify zero or one *Instance type* under  *Launch template contents* in a launch template. Alternatively, you can specify 0–20 instance types for  *Instance types* on the  *Set compute and scaling configuration* page in the console. Or, you can do so using other tools that use the Amazon EKS API. If you specify an instance type in a launch template, and use that launch template to deploy your node group, then you can't specify any instance types in the console or using other tools that use the Amazon EKS API. If you don't specify an instance type in a launch template, in the console, or using other tools that use the Amazon EKS API, the `t3.medium` instance type is used. If your node group is using the Spot capacity type, then we recommend specifying multiple instance types using the console. For more information, see <<managed-node-group-capacity-types>>. 
* If any containers that you deploy to the node group use the Instance Metadata Service Version 2, make sure to set the *Metadata response hop limit* to `2` in your launch template. For more information, see link:AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-instance-metadata.html[Instance metadata and user data,type="documentation"] in the _Amazon EC2 User Guide_. If you deploy a managed node group without using a custom launch template, this value is automatically set for the node group in the default launch template.

====

[[launch-template-tagging,launch-template-tagging.title]]
== Tagging Amazon EC2 instances

You can use the `TagSpecification` parameter of a launch template to specify which tags to apply to Amazon EC2 instances in your node group. The IAM entity calling the `CreateNodegroup` or `UpdateNodegroupVersion` APIs must have permissions for `ec2:RunInstances` and `ec2:CreateTags`, and the tags must be added to the launch template.

[[launch-template-security-groups,launch-template-security-groups.title]]
== Using custom security groups

You can use a launch template to specify custom Amazon EC2 link:AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-security-groups.html[security groups,type="documentation"] to apply to instances in your node group. This can be either in the instance level security groups parameter or as part of the network interface configuration parameters. However, you can't create a launch template that specifies both instance level and network interface security groups. Consider the following conditions that apply to using custom security groups with managed node groups:



* When using the {aws-management-console}, Amazon EKS only allows launch templates with a single network interface specification.
* By default, Amazon EKS applies the <<sec-group-reqs,cluster security group>> to the instances in your node group to facilitate communication between nodes and the control plane. If you specify custom security groups in the launch template using either option mentioned earlier, Amazon EKS doesn't add the cluster security group. So, you must ensure that the inbound and outbound rules of your security groups enable communication with the endpoint of your cluster. If your security group rules are incorrect, the worker nodes can't join the cluster. For more information about security group rules, see <<sec-group-reqs>>.
* If you need SSH access to the instances in your node group, include a security group that allows that access.


[[launch-template-user-data,launch-template-user-data.title]]
== Amazon EC2 user data

The launch template includes a section for custom user data. You can specify configuration settings for your node group in this section without manually creating individual custom AMIs. For more information about the settings available for [.noloc]`Bottlerocket`, see https://github.com/bottlerocket-os/bottlerocket#using-user-data[Using user data] on [.noloc]`GitHub`.

You can supply Amazon EC2 user data in your launch template using `cloud-init` when launching your instances. For more information, see the https://cloudinit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html[cloud-init] documentation. Your user data can be used to perform common configuration operations. This includes the following operations:



* https://cloudinit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/topics/examples.html#including-users-and-groups[Including users or groups]
* https://cloudinit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/topics/examples.html#install-arbitrary-packages[Installing packages]

Amazon EC2 user data in launch templates that are used with managed node groups must be in the https://cloudinit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/topics/format.html#mime-multi-part-archive[MIME multi-part archive] format for Amazon Linux AMIs and TOML format for [.noloc]`Bottlerocket` AMIs. This is because your user data is merged with Amazon EKS user data required for nodes to join the cluster. Don't specify any commands in your user data that starts or modifies `kubelet`. This is performed as part of the user data merged by Amazon EKS. Certain `kubelet` parameters, such as setting labels on nodes, can be configured directly through the managed node groups API.

[NOTE]
====

For more information about advanced `kubelet` customization, including manually starting it or passing in custom configuration parameters, see <<launch-template-custom-ami>>. If a custom AMI ID is specified in a launch template, Amazon EKS doesn't merge user data.

====

The following details provide more information about the user data section.



*Amazon Linux 2 user data*::
You can combine multiple user data blocks together into a single MIME multi-part file. For example, you can combine a cloud boothook that configures the [.noloc]`Docker` daemon with a user data shell script that installs a custom package. A MIME multi-part file consists of the following components:
+
** The content type and part boundary declaration – `Content-Type: multipart/mixed; boundary="==MYBOUNDARY=="`
** The MIME version declaration – `MIME-Version: 1.0`
** One or more user data blocks, which contain the following components:
+
*** The opening boundary, which signals the beginning of a user data block – `--==MYBOUNDARY==`
*** The content type declaration for the block: `Content-Type: text/cloud-config; charset="us-ascii"`. For more information about content types, see the https://cloudinit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/topics/format.html[cloud-init] documentation.
*** The content of the user data (for example, a list of shell commands or `cloud-init` directives).
*** The closing boundary, which signals the end of the MIME multi-part file: `--==MYBOUNDARY==--`

+
The following is an example of a MIME multi-part file that you can use to create your own.
+
[source,none,subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: multipart/mixed; boundary="==MYBOUNDARY=="

--==MYBOUNDARY==
Content-Type: text/x-shellscript; charset="us-ascii"

#!/bin/bash
echo "Running custom user data script"

--==MYBOUNDARY==--
----


*Amazon Linux 2023 user data*::
Amazon Linux 2023 (AL2023) introduces a new node initialization process `nodeadm` that uses a YAML configuration schema. If you're using self-managed node groups or an AMI with a launch template, you'll now need to provide additional cluster metadata explicitly when creating a new node group. An https://awslabs.github.io/amazon-eks-ami/nodeadm/[example] of the minimum required parameters is as follows, where `apiServerEndpoint`, `certificateAuthority`, and service `cidr` are now required:
+
[source,yaml,subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
---
apiVersion: node.eks.aws/v1alpha1
kind: NodeConfig
spec:
  cluster:
    name: my-cluster
    apiServerEndpoint: https://example.com
    certificateAuthority: Y2VydGlmaWNhdGVBdXRob3JpdHk=
    cidr: 10.100.0.0/16
----
+
You'll typically set this configuration in your user data, either as-is or embedded within a MIME multi-part document:
+
[source,bash,subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
MIME-Version: 1.0 
Content-Type: multipart/mixed; boundary="BOUNDARY"

--BOUNDARY
Content-Type: application/node.eks.aws

---
apiVersion: node.eks.aws/v1alpha1
kind: NodeConfig spec: [...]

--BOUNDARY--
----
+
In AL2, the metadata from these parameters was discovered from the Amazon EKS `DescribeCluster` API call. With AL2023, this behavior has changed since the additional API call risks throttling during large node scale ups. This change doesn't affect you if you're using managed node groups without a launch template or if you're using [.noloc]`Karpenter`. For more information on `certificateAuthority` and service `cidr`, see ` link:eks/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeCluster.html[DescribeCluster,type="documentation"]` in the _Amazon EKS API Reference_.


*[.noloc]`Bottlerocket` user data*::
[.noloc]`Bottlerocket` structures user data in the TOML format. You can provide user data to be merged with the user data provided by Amazon EKS. For example, you can provide additional `kubelet` settings.
+
[source,none,subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
[settings.kubernetes.system-reserved]
cpu = "10m"
memory = "100Mi"
ephemeral-storage= "1Gi"
----
+
For more information about the supported settings, see https://github.com/bottlerocket-os/bottlerocket[Bottlerocket documentation]. You can configure node labels and <<node-taints-managed-node-groups,taints>> in your user data. However, we recommend that you configure these within your node group instead. Amazon EKS applies these configurations when you do so.
+
When user data is merged, formatting isn't preserved, but the content remains the same. The configuration that you provide in your user data overrides any settings that are configured by Amazon EKS. So, if you set `settings.kubernetes.max-pods` or `settings.kubernetes.cluster-dns-ip`, these values in your user data are applied to the nodes.
+
Amazon EKS doesn't support all valid TOML. The following is a list of known unsupported formats:
+
** Quotes within quoted keys: `'quoted "value"' = "value"`
** Escaped quotes in values: `str = "I'm a string. \"You can quote me\""`
** Mixed floats and integers: `numbers = [ 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1, 2, 5 ]`
** Mixed types in arrays: `contributors = ["foo@example.com", { name = "Baz", email = "baz@example.com" }]`
** Bracketed headers with quoted keys: `[foo."bar.baz"]`


*[.noloc]`Windows` user data*::
Windows user data uses [.noloc]`PowerShell` commands. When creating a managed node group, your custom user data combines with Amazon EKS managed user data. Your [.noloc]`PowerShell` commands come first, followed by the managed user data commands, all within one `<powershell></powershell>` tag.
+
NOTE: When no AMI ID is specified in the launch template, don't use the Windows Amazon EKS Bootstrap script in user data to configure Amazon EKS.
+
Example user data is as follows.

Bootstrapping is a term used to describe adding commands that can be run when an instance starts. For example, bootstrapping allows using extra https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/kubelet/[kubelet] arguments.

====

Bootstrapping is a term used to describe adding commands that can be run when an instance starts. You can pass arguments to the `Start-EKSBootstrap.ps1` script by using `eksctl` without specifying a launch template. Or you can do so by specifying the information in the user data section of a launch template.

If you want to specify a custom [.noloc]`Windows` AMI ID, keep in mind the following considerations:



* You must use a launch template and give the required bootstrap commands in the user data section. To retrieve your desired [.noloc]`Windows` ID, you can use the table in  <<eks-optimized-windows-ami,Create nodes with optimized Windows AMIs>>.
* There are several limits and conditions. For example, you must add `eks:kube-proxy-windows` to your {aws} IAM Authenticator configuration map. For more information, see <<mng-ami-id-conditions>>.

Specify the following information in the user data section of your launch template. Replace every [.replaceable]`example value` with your own values. The `-APIServerEndpoint`, `-Base64ClusterCA`, and `-DNSClusterIP` arguments are optional. However, defining them allows the `Start-EKSBootstrap.ps1` script to avoid making a `describeCluster` call.



* The only required argument is the cluster name ([.replaceable]`my-cluster`).
* To retrieve the [.replaceable]`certificate-authority` for your cluster, run the following command.

For more information, see link:AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/AMIs.html[Amazon Machine Images (AMI),type="documentation"] in the _Amazon EC2 User Guide_. The Amazon EKS AMI build specification contains resources and configuration scripts for building a custom Amazon EKS AMI based on Amazon Linux.

[IMPORTANT]
====

When specifying an AMI, Amazon EKS doesn't merge any user data. Rather, you're responsible for supplying the required `bootstrap` commands for nodes to join the cluster. If your nodes fail to join the cluster, the Amazon EKS `CreateNodegroup` and `UpdateNodegroupVersion` actions also fail.

[[mng-ami-id-conditions,mng-ami-id-conditions.title]]
== Limits and conditions when specifying an AMI ID

The following are the limits and conditions involved with specifying an AMI ID with managed node groups:



* You must create a new node group to switch between specifying an AMI ID in a launch template and not specifying an AMI ID.
* You aren't notified in the console when a newer AMI version is available. To update your node group to a newer AMI version, you need to create a new version of your launch template with an updated AMI ID. Then, you need to update the node group with the new launch template version. 
* The following fields can't be set in the API if you specify an AMI ID:
+
** `amiType`
** `releaseVersion`
** `version`
* Any `taints` set in the API are applied asynchronously if you specify an AMI ID. To apply taints prior to a node joining the cluster, you must pass the taints to `kubelet` in your user data using the `--register-with-taints` command line flag. For more information, see https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/kubelet/[kubelet] in the [.noloc]`Kubernetes` documentation.
* When specifying a custom AMI ID for [.noloc]`Windows` managed node groups, add `eks:kube-proxy-windows` to your {aws} IAM Authenticator configuration map. This is required for DNS to function properly.
+
