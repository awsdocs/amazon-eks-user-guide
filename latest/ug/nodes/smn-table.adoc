|Yes

|Can be deployed to an <<local-zones,{aws} Local Zone>>
|Yes

|Can run containers that require [.noloc]`Windows`
|<<windows-support,Yes>> – Your cluster still requires at least one (two recommended for availability) [.noloc]`Linux` node though.

|Can run containers that require [.noloc]`Linux`
|Yes

|Can run workloads that require the Inferentia chip
|<<inferentia-support,Yes>> – Amazon Linux only

|Can run workloads that require a GPU
|<<gpu-ami,Yes>> – Amazon Linux only

|Can run workloads that require Arm processors
|<<arm-ami,Yes>>

|Can run {aws} link:bottlerocket/[Bottlerocket,type="marketing"]
|<<launch-node-bottlerocket,Yes>>

|Pods share a kernel runtime environment with other [.noloc]`Pods`
|Yes – All of your [.noloc]`Pods` on each of your nodes

|Pods share CPU, memory, storage, and network resources with other [.noloc]`Pods`.
|Yes – Can result in unused resources on each node 

|Pods can use more hardware and memory than requested in [.noloc]`Pod` specs
|Yes – If the [.noloc]`Pod` requires more resources than requested, and resources are available on the node, the [.noloc]`Pod` can use additional resources.

|Must deploy and manage Amazon EC2 instances
|Yes – Manual configuration or using Amazon EKS provided {aws} CloudFormation templates to deploy <<launch-workers,Linux (x86)>>, <<arm-ami,Linux (Arm)>>, or <<windows-support,Windows>> nodes.

|Must secure, maintain, and patch the operating system of Amazon EC2 instances
|Yes

|Can provide bootstrap arguments at deployment of a node, such as extra https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/kubelet/[kubelet] arguments.
|Yes – For more information, see the https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-eks-ami/blob/main/templates/al2/runtime/bootstrap.sh[bootstrap script usage information] on [.noloc]`GitHub`.

|Can assign IP addresses to [.noloc]`Pods` from a different CIDR block than the IP address assigned to the node.
|Yes – For more information, see <<cni-custom-network>>.

|Can SSH into node
|Yes

|Can deploy your own custom AMI to nodes
|Yes

|Can deploy your own custom CNI to nodes
|Yes

|Must update node AMI on your own
|<<update-stack,Yes>> – Using tools other than the Amazon EKS console. This is because self-managed nodes can't be managed with the Amazon EKS console.

|Must update node [.noloc]`Kubernetes` version on your own
|<<update-stack,Yes>> – Using tools other than the Amazon EKS console. This is because self-managed nodes can't be managed with the Amazon EKS console.

|Can use Amazon EBS storage with [.noloc]`Pods`
|<<ebs-csi,Yes>>

|Can use Amazon EFS storage with [.noloc]`Pods`
|<<efs-csi,Yes>>

|Can use Amazon FSx for Lustre storage with [.noloc]`Pods`
|<<fsx-csi,Yes>>

|Can use Network Load Balancer for services
|<<network-load-balancing,Yes>>

|Pods can run in a public subnet
|Yes

|Can assign different VPC security groups to individual [.noloc]`Pods`
|<<security-groups-for-pods,Yes>> – [.noloc]`Linux` nodes only

|Can run [.noloc]`Kubernetes` [.noloc]`DaemonSets`
|Yes

|Support `HostPort` and `HostNetwork` in the [.noloc]`Pod` manifest
|Yes

|{aws} Region availability
|link:general/latest/gr/eks.html[All Amazon EKS supported regions,type="documentation"]
